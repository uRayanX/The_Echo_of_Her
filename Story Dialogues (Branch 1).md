# THE ECHO OF HER
## ACTS 1 & 2 - SHARED OPENING

---

## ACT I: THE AWAKENING

### FADE IN:

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT (2:57 AM)
*March 14, 2022*

RUMI BIN IMRAN (24), disheveled and groggy, stumbles through his modest home. The silence is oppressive. He reaches for a glass of water when his PHONE RINGS, the sound cutting through the quiet like a blade.

**RUMI**  
(checking phone)  
Unknown number... at this hour?

He hesitates, then answers.

**RUMI**  
Hello?

**POLICE OFFICER (V.O.)**  
(official tone)  
Am I speaking to Rumi Bin Imran?

**RUMI**  
(suddenly alert)  
Yes... who is this?

**POLICE OFFICER (V.O.)**  
Sir, we're calling from Shyamoli Square. There's been a car accident.

Rumi's face drains of color. His hand grips the counter.

**RUMI**  
And?

**POLICE OFFICER (V.O.)**  
(gentler)  
We found a deceased individual. We believe it's your wife.

The glass slips from Rumi's hand, SHATTERING on the floor.

### INT. LAB AID HOSPITAL - MORGUE - NIGHT (3:23 AM)

Sterile fluorescent lights buzz overhead. Rumi stands frozen before a covered body on a gurney. A POLICE OFFICER nods to the MEDICAL EXAMINER, who slowly pulls back the sheet.

Rumi's knees buckle. It's JANNAT (22), his wife, her face peaceful but lifeless.

**RUMI**  
(whispering)  
No... no, this can't be...

He reaches out with trembling fingers to touch her hand.

**RUMI**  
(breaking down)  
She was supposed to come home tonight... we were going to... we were going to...

His words dissolve into sobs. The room spins. He collapses.

### INT. RUMI'S FATHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING (8:40 AM)

Rumi jolts awake on an unfamiliar bed. His FATHER (55) sits nearby, weathered face etched with concern.

**RUMI**  
(panicked)  
Baba, where's Jannat? Where is she?

His father's silence speaks volumes. The terrible reality crashes back.

**RUMI**  
(screaming)  
NO! She can't be gone! She can't be!

He breaks down completely, his father holding him as he sobs.

---

## ACT II: THREE YEARS LATER

### TITLE CARD: "THREE YEARS LATER"

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING (6:40 PM)
*April 3, 2025*

The same house, but hollow now. RUMI (27) sits motionless on the sofa, still in his work clothes. The furniture remains unchanged, but everything feels like a museum to the dead.

He stares at a framed photo of him and Jannat on their wedding day. Her smile seems to mock his emptiness.

**RUMI**  
(to the photo)  
Three years, Jannat. Three years and I still can't... I can't let you go.

He sets down the photo and rises, mechanical in his movements.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Rumi prepares tea with practiced routine. He places the kettle and TWO cups on a tray - an old habit he can't break.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (6:51 PM)

Rumi sets the tray on the coffee table and begins pouring tea into one cup. He reaches for biscuits.

**RUMI**  
Almost forgot theâ€”

A LOUD CRASH. He spins around. The kettle lies on the floor, tea spreading everywhere. A shadow moves past the window.

**RUMI**  
(startled)  
How did that happen?

He approaches the window cautiously, peering through the curtains.


**FADE TO BLACK - END OF SHARED ACTS**

## BRANCH TRANSITION ACTS

## BRANCH 1: THE CAT INCIDENT
### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (7:40 PM)

Rumi goes closer to the window and realizes the windows are closed, which is strange - he thought they were open. The curtains are swaying from wind outside.

As he opens the window, a CAT suddenly jumps out from behind the curtains and runs away into the night.

**RUMI**  
(startled, then relieved)  
Jesus... just a cat.

He looks at the mess - the plastic kettle on the floor, tea everywhere. Surprisingly, the kettle isn't cracked despite the fall.

**RUMI**  
(to himself)  
Huh. Didn't realize this thing was so durable. Five years and still going strong.

He goes to get a mop and cleans up the spill. By the time he's done, his mood for tea has completely evaporated.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT (8:30 PM)

Rumi sits alone at the dining table with a simple meal - rice and vegetable curry. The silence in the house feels heavier tonight, more oppressive than usual.

He eats mechanically, lost in thought, occasionally glancing at the empty chair across from him where Jannat used to sit.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT (8:45 PM)

After dinner, Rumi washes the dishes. It's a routine he maintains religiously - he can't do it in the morning because there's no time before work.

As he scrubs a plate, he catches his reflection in the window above the sink. For a moment, the face staring back looks like a stranger.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (9:00 PM)

Rumi settles in to watch TV, but the screen keeps flickering badly - much worse than the usual satellite issues. Static cuts through the picture every few seconds.

He goes to check the window and notices it's pouring rain outside. Heavy sheets of water cascade down the glass.

**RUMI**  
(surprised)  
When did that start? I didn't even hear it begin.

The storm seems to have come out of nowhere. Lightning flashes, illuminating the empty street.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT (10:10 PM)

The rain pounds against the windows with increasing intensity. Rumi lies in bed, unable to sleep despite his exhaustion. The room feels unusually cold for April.

Thunder RUMBLES overhead, growing closer. Each flash of lightning throws strange shadows across the walls.

**RUMI**  
(pulling blankets tighter)  
Storm came out of nowhere...

A particularly loud CRASH of thunder makes him jump. But then he realizes - that sound came from inside the house.

**RUMI**  
(sitting up)  
What the hell?

---

## SUB-BRANCH 1.1: THE SUPPRESSED MEMORY

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Rumi enters to find the impossible - the exact same scene as hours before. The kettle on the floor, tea everywhere, windows blown open by wind and rain.

**RUMI**  
(backing away, frightened)  
This is impossible... this happened hours ago... I cleaned this up...

The wind howls through the opening, but there's something wrong with the sound - it's too deliberate, too purposeful.

**JANNAT (O.S.)**  
(gentle voice)  
Keep them open. The weather feels nice and cozy.

Rumi freezes. The voice he's longed to hear for three years, but hasn't heard since that terrible night.

**RUMI**  
(whisper)  
No... it can't be...

He turns slowly. JANNAT (22) sits on the sofa, but she's wrong - horrifically wrong. Blood covers the right side of her face, her skull caved in, brain matter visible through shattered bone.

**JANNAT**  
(smiling sadly)  
You know I like rain, don't you?

**RUMI**  
(approaching cautiously)  
Jannat? How... how are you here?

He sits beside her, tears streaming down his face.

**RUMI**  
Hi.

**JANNAT**  
Look what you've done to me.

**RUMI**  
(shaking head frantically)  
No. Marzia did this. It was Marzia in the car accident.

**JANNAT**  
(hollow laugh)  
Is that what you've told yourself for three years? Is that the lie you've been living?

The television flickers on by itself, showing static.

**JANNAT**  
Watch. Watch what you did to me.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - FLASHBACK (6:40 PM, March 13, 2022)

The static clears to reveal younger RUMI and JANNAT arguing violently. She's packing a suitcase.

**JANNAT (FLASHBACK)**  
I can't do this anymore, Rumi. Your paranoia, your jealousy - it's destroying us. I need space.

**RUMI (FLASHBACK)**  
You're leaving me for him, aren't you? For that doctor you work with?

**JANNAT (FLASHBACK)**  
There's nothing between me and Dr. Nabil! This is exactly what I'm talking about - these delusions!

**RUMI (FLASHBACK)**  
LIAR!

He grabs her shoulders, shaking her violently.

**JANNAT (FLASHBACK)**  
(screaming)  
Those texts were about our baby, you idiot! I'm pregnant! He's my obstetrician! I was going to surprise you on your birthday!

Rumi-present watches in horror as his past self leaves the room, returning with a hammer from his toolbox.

**RUMI**  
(present, backing away)  
No... that's not what happened...

On screen, Past-Rumi brings the hammer down on Jannat's skull with savage force. The crunch of bone is sickeningly loud.

**JANNAT**  
(present, calmly)  
You beat me to death. You beat our unborn child to death. And then you called Marzia to help you cover it up.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - PRESENT NIGHT

**RUMI**  
(collapsing)  
I... I remember now. The blood. The sound when I...

**JANNAT**  
You killed two people that night, Rumi. Me and our son.

**RUMI**  
(sobbing)  
What have I done? What have I become?

The television shows more footage - MARZIA arriving, helping to clean up, staging the car accident.

**JANNAT**  
She's been medicating you for three years. Not for grief - to control your violent episodes. To keep you from remembering what you did.

A KNOCK at the door.

**MARZIA (O.S.)**  
Rumi? Are you awake? I heard shouting.

**JANNAT**  
She's here to keep the monster contained. The question is: what will you do with the truth?

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (1:15 AM)

MARZIA enters with her medical bag, eyes widening at Rumi's state.

**MARZIA**  
Rumi, you haven't been taking your medication, have you?

**RUMI**  
I remember everything, Marzia.

Her face goes pale.

**RUMI**  
The hammer. The blood. The sound her skull made when I... I killed her. I killed my pregnant wife.

**MARZIA**  
(gently)  
You're having an episode, Rumi. Let me help you.

**RUMI**  
(roaring)  
Stop LYING! I saw it! Jannat showed me the truth!

He points to where Jannat sits, but Marzia sees only empty space.

**MARZIA**  
(preparing syringe)  
These delusions - you need your medication.

**RUMI**  
(grabbing lamp, hurling it)  
They're not delusions! I killed her because I thought she was cheating. But she wasn't. She was pregnant with my child.

**MARZIA**  
(clinical demeanor cracking)  
Yes. She was. And you've spent three years blocking it out because your mind couldn't handle the guilt.

**RUMI**  
Without the medication, I remember the truth. That I'm a murderer. That you helped me cover it up.

**MARZIA**  
(tears streaming)  
I had no choice. I loved you. I thought I could keep you stable, keep you from hurting anyone else.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (1:45 AM)

**MARZIA**  
I should have gone to the police. But I'd already helped move the body. I was complicit. So I convinced myself that keeping you medicated was the best I could do.

**RUMI**  
All these years, I thought you were my friend.

**MARZIA**  
I was your jailer. Your psychiatric nurse. Because you destroyed your conscience with the same hammer you used on Jannat's skull.

Rumi lunges at her, hands around her throat.

**RUMI**  
You should have let me face justice!

**MARZIA**  
(choking)  
Rumi, please - this isn't you, it's the illness!

**RUMI**  
No. This is exactly who I am. A murderer.

**JANNAT**  
(appearing beside him)  
This won't bring me back. This won't bring our baby back.

Rumi's grip loosens. Marzia gasps for air.

**JANNAT**  
She tried to help you, in her way. Killing her won't make things right.

**RUMI**  
(releasing Marzia)  
Get out. Get out and call the police. Tell them I'm confessing to the murder of Jannat.

**MARZIA**  
(staggering)  
Rumi, you're not well-

**RUMI**  
(grabbing kitchen knife)  
GET OUT! Call the police, or I swear I'll finish what I started.

She flees. Rumi turns to Jannat's ghost.

**RUMI**  
What happens now?

**JANNAT**  
Now you face the truth.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (2:30 AM)

Police sirens approach. Jannat's ghost moves closer.

**JANNAT**  
They'll take you away. Prison, or a psychiatric facility. Is that justice enough?

Rumi looks at the knife in his hand.

**RUMI**  
No. It's not enough.

**JANNAT**  
What would be enough?

**RUMI**  
(raising knife)  
The same pain I inflicted. The same destruction.

**JANNAT**  
Show me you understand what you did to me.

Rumi draws the blade across his forearm. Blood wells up.

**RUMI**  
(sobbing, cutting again)  
I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (2:45 AM)

Police break down the door to find Rumi on his knees in a pool of blood, arms ribboned with wounds.

**RUMI**  
(calmly to officers)  
I killed my wife. Three years ago. I beat her to death with a hammer because I thought she was unfaithful. She was pregnant with my child.

**POLICE OFFICER**  
Sir, you need medical attention.

**RUMI**  
No. I need to confess now.

As paramedics work to save him, Rumi recounts every detail. Throughout his confession, he looks to the corner where officers see nothing - but he sees Jannat, whole and unblemished, smiling sadly.

**RUMI**  
(to her)  
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

### INT. PSYCHIATRIC WARD - DAY (Two Weeks Later)

The ward is sterile, devoid of sharp objects. Rumi's arms are heavily bandaged. MARZIA visits in her professional capacity, bruises still visible on her throat.

**MARZIA**  
The police found the hammer. Hidden in the attic, just where you said. The DNA evidence confirmed everything.

**RUMI**  
Will you be charged?

**MARZIA**  
Accessory after the fact. I'll lose my license. Serve some time.

**RUMI**  
I'm sorry. For dragging you into this.

**MARZIA**  
I made my own choices.

As she leaves, Rumi calls after her.

**RUMI**  
Do you think she can rest now? Now that the truth is known?

**MARZIA**  
Jannat is gone, Rumi. The only ghosts are the ones in your mind.

But as the door closes, Rumi feels her presence beside him. Jannat sits on his bed, whole and beautiful.

**RUMI**  
Are you still here to torment me?

**JANNAT**  
No. I'm here to help you heal. The truth is out. Justice is being served.

**RUMI**  
Will you ever forgive me?

**JANNAT**  
(touching his cheek)  
Forgiveness isn't what you need from me. You need to forgive yourself enough to face your illness, to get the help you've needed all along.

**RUMI**  
And then?

**JANNAT**  
(beginning to fade)  
You live with what you've done. You carry it. That's your sentence. That's your penance.

As she disappears into the sunlight, Rumi feels something shift - not peace, but perhaps the foundation upon which peace might someday be built.

The echo of her presence lingers, no longer an accusation but a reminder of the terrible truth he must never forget.

**FADE TO BLACK.**

**THE END**

## BRANCH 1.2: VENGEFUL SPIRIT

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (7:40 PM)

Rumi goes closer to the window and realizes the windows are closed, which is strange - he thought they were open. The curtains are swaying from wind outside.

As he opens the window, a CAT suddenly jumps out from behind the curtains and runs away into the night.

**RUMI**  
(startled, then relieved)  
Jesus... just a cat.

He looks at the mess - the plastic kettle on the floor, tea everywhere. Surprisingly, the kettle isn't cracked despite the fall.

**RUMI**  
(to himself)  
Huh. Didn't realize this thing was so durable. Five years and still going strong.

He goes to get a mop and cleans up the spill. By the time he's done, his mood for tea has completely evaporated.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT (8:30 PM)

Rumi sits alone at the dining table with a simple meal - rice and vegetable curry. The silence in the house feels heavier tonight, more oppressive than usual.

He eats mechanically, lost in thought, occasionally glancing at the empty chair across from him where Jannat used to sit.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (9:00 PM)

Rumi settles in to watch TV, but the screen keeps flickering badly - much worse than the usual satellite issues. Static cuts through the picture every few seconds.

He goes to check the window and notices it's pouring rain outside. Heavy sheets of water cascade down the glass.

**RUMI**  
(surprised)  
When did that start? I didn't even hear it begin.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT (10:10 PM)

The rain pounds against the windows with increasing intensity. Rumi lies in bed, unable to sleep despite his exhaustion. The room feels unusually cold for April.

Thunder RUMBLES overhead, growing closer. Each flash of lightning throws strange shadows across the walls.

A particularly loud CRASH of thunder makes him jump. But then he realizes - that sound came from inside the house.

**RUMI**  
(sitting up)  
What the hell? Not again...

---

## SUB-BRANCH 1.2: THE VENGEFUL TRUTH

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The impossible has happened. The exact same scene - kettle on the floor, tea everywhere, windows blown open by the wind.

**RUMI**  
(backing away, frightened)  
This is impossible... this happened hours ago...

The room grows frigidly cold. Frost begins forming on the windows despite the spring weather. His breath becomes visible in the suddenly arctic air.

**RUMI**  
(approaching window cautiously)  
What the hell is going on?

**JANNAT (O.S.)**  
(hollow, echoing voice)  
Keep them open. The weather feels nice and cozy.

Rumi freezes. The voice he's longed to hear, but wrong - distorted, otherworldly.

**RUMI**  
(turning slowly)  
Jannat?

JANNAT (22) sits on the sofa, but she's a nightmare version of his beloved wife. Her skull is partially caved in, brain matter visible through shattered bone, her neck bent at an unnatural angle.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (11:30 PM)

**RUMI**  
(approaching cautiously)  
Jannat? How... how are you here?

**JANNAT**  
(hollow, echoing quality)  
I've been waiting for you to see me, Rumi. Really see me.

**RUMI**  
I don't understand. You died in a car accident.

**JANNAT**  
Did I? Or is that just what she wanted everyone to believe?

The temperature drops further. The television flickers to life, showing static that gradually resolves into grainy security camera footage.

### SECURITY FOOTAGE - HOSPITAL PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT (March 14, 2022)

The timestamp shows the night Jannat died. JANNAT walks alone through the garage, distressed, on the phone.

**JANNAT (PRESENT)**  
(voice-over)  
I was calling you. I had discovered something terrible about Marzia, and I was trying to warn you.

On screen, DR. MARZIA RAHMAN appears from behind, carrying something metallic.

**JANNAT (PRESENT)**  
But you didn't answer.

The two women begin arguing. Suddenly, Marzia raises a tire iron and brings it down on Jannat's head with savage force.

**RUMI**  
(horrified)  
What did you discover?

**JANNAT (PRESENT)**  
She had been drugging you, Rumi. For months. Small doses that made you more susceptible to suggestion.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (12:15 AM)

The footage continues in gruesome detail. After dropping Jannat, Marzia doesn't stop. She continues beating Jannat's head, each strike more vicious.

**JANNAT**  
She told me she had been slowly poisoning your mind against me. Planting doubts about my faithfulness so that when she struck, you would believe any story.

**RUMI**  
This is horrible. Why would she do this?

**JANNAT**  
Because she discovered I was pregnant.

### TRAFFIC CAMERA FOOTAGE - SHYAMOLI SQUARE - LATER THAT NIGHT

The screen changes to show Marzia positioning Jannat's mutilated corpse behind the wheel.

**JANNAT**  
I was awake for part of it. The first few blows didn't kill me immediately. I felt her dragging my body, felt the gravel scraping against my exposed brain tissue.

Marzia uses a sledgehammer to further destroy the car's interior and what remains of Jannat's skull.

**JANNAT**  
She took a sledgehammer to what was left of my head. She wanted to make sure no one would ever tell that she had beaten me to death first.

**RUMI**  
(tears streaming)  
Why? Why would she torture you like this?

**JANNAT**  
Because I was carrying your child, and she couldn't bear anyone else having the family she wanted with you.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (12:45 AM)

Jannat's spirit becomes more solid. The room fills with jasmine mixed with metallic blood.

**JANNAT**  
I had just found out that morning. I was so excited. I bought tiny baby shoes to surprise you when you came home.

**RUMI**  
We were going to have a child?

**JANNAT**  
But when I went to Marzia for a pregnancy checkup, she seemed devastated instead of happy. That's when I started putting pieces together.

She moves closer, her mangled face inches from his.

**JANNAT**  
I realized she had been in love with you for years. Photos dating back to childhood, journals about you obsessively, detailed plans for eliminating obstacles.

**RUMI**  
She was planning this for a long time?

**JANNAT**  
For years. My pregnancy was the final trigger that pushed her over the edge.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (1:15 AM)

The front door opens. MARZIA'S voice calls out.

**MARZIA (O.S.)**  
Rumi? Are you awake? I brought your medication. I was worried about the storm.

**JANNAT**  
(urgent)  
She's here. She's been coming every night since I died, making sure you stay medicated, stay compliant.

**RUMI**  
Different how?

**JANNAT**  
Tonight is the three-year anniversary. She's not here to drug you. She's here to kill you the same way she killed me.

MARZIA appears in the doorway, but instead of her medical bag, she carries the same tire iron and a sledgehammer.

**MARZIA**  
(eerily calm)  
Hello, Rumi. I see you're having trouble sleeping again.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (1:30 AM)

**MARZIA**  
Three years is long enough to grieve, don't you think? Tonight, you join your beloved wife.

**RUMI**  
Marzia, what are you doing?

**MARZIA**  
I gave you three years to fall in love with me. But you're still as obsessed with that dead bitch as the day I caved her skull in.

**JANNAT**  
(to Rumi)  
She planned this from the beginning. Make you dependent for three years, then when you failed to love her, kill you the same brutal way.

**MARZIA**  
Just like I beat her to death. I'm going to crush your skull the same way, one savage blow at a time. But I'll make you last longer. She only took twelve hits to die. You're going to take twenty.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (1:45 AM)

Marzia raises the sledgehammer.

**MARZIA**  
I want you to know exactly how she died. I want you to experience every moment of agony I put her through.

**RUMI**  
You're insane.

**MARZIA**  
(swinging)  
I'm in love! If I can't have you in life, then in death you'll be free from her memory!

The hammer smashes into the wall as Rumi ducks. Suddenly, Jannat's spirit becomes corporeal, grabbing the sledgehammer handle.

**JANNAT**  
(solid, real)  
Not if I have anything to say about it.

Marzia staggers backward, shocked.

**MARZIA**  
Impossible.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (2:00 AM)

**JANNAT**  
Three years of rage, three years of unfinished business. You think death is the end? You think murder goes unpunished?

Jannat wrestles the sledgehammer away. Marzia pulls out the tire iron.

**MARZIA**  
You're not real. You're just his grief-induced hallucination.

**JANNAT**  
Then why are you so afraid?

Jannat's spirit transforms, becoming more terrifying. Her wounds become more pronounced, brain matter dripping from her shattered skull.

**JANNAT**  
(hissing)  
You want to know what it felt like? To have your skull crushed piece by piece while you begged for mercy? To feel your baby die inside you with each blow?

**MARZIA**  
(screaming)  
Stay away from me!

She swings the tire iron wildly, but Jannat catches it mid-swing and raises the sledgehammer with supernatural strength.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (2:15 AM)

The first blow cracks Marzia's skull open. Blood and brain matter spray across the room as she falls to her knees, still conscious.

**MARZIA**  
(whimpering, blood pouring)  
Please... I only wanted to love you.

**JANNAT**  
This is how you showed love? By torturing an innocent woman and her unborn child to death?

The second blow caves in the left side of Marzia's head completely. Her left eye pops out, dangling by the optic nerve. She lives, gurgling on blood.

**JANNAT**  
(raising hammer)  
One more, for our baby.

The third blow turns Marzia's head into paste. Skull fragments, brain tissue, and blood explode across the room like a grotesque firework.

Police sirens wail in the distance as Jannat's spirit begins to fade.

**JANNAT**  
(whisper)  
Finally. Justice.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (2:45 AM)

Police burst through the door to find unimaginable carnage. Marzia lies dead, head completely destroyed. Blood and brain matter paint the walls.

Standing over her with the sledgehammer is RUMI.

**RUMI**  
(calmly)  
She killed my wife. She confessed everything before I stopped her.

**POLICE OFFICER**  
Sir, drop the weapon and get on your knees.

**RUMI**  
(complying)  
In her medical bag, you'll find drugs she was using to control me. In her apartment, there's evidence. She kept trophies from my wife's murder.

### INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAWN (5:00 AM)

DETECTIVE sits across from Rumi, closing a folder of preliminary findings.

**DETECTIVE**  
We've seen disturbed individuals, Mr. Bin Imran, but this... The level of premeditation, the years of manipulation...

**RUMI**  
What happens now?

**DETECTIVE**  
We're reopening your wife's case. We'll exhume her body. Given the evidence in Dr. Rahman's apartment, it's clear you acted in self-defense.

**RUMI**  
She was going to kill me the same way she killed Jannat.

**DETECTIVE**  
You're free to go home for now. We don't anticipate charges being filed against you.

### EXT. CEMETERY - DAY (Three Months Later)

Rumi stands beside two graves - Jannat's and a smaller one reading "Baby Bin Imran - Never Born But Always Loved." He places tiny baby shoes on the small mound.

**RUMI**  
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you both. But she can't hurt anyone anymore.

As he turns to leave, warmth envelops him. The scent of jasmine fills the air. For a brief moment, he sees them - Jannat, whole and healthy, holding a small child with his eyes.

They don't speak but smile before fading into the setting sun.

For the first time in three years, the echo of her voice isn't filled with pain - it's a whisper of peace, of closure, of a promise that someday, they'll be together again.
