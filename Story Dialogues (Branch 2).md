## ACTS 1 & 2 - SHARED OPENING

---

## ACT I: THE AWAKENING

### FADE IN:

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT (2:57 AM)
*March 14, 2022*

RUMI BIN IMRAN (24), disheveled and groggy, stumbles through his modest home. The silence is oppressive. He reaches for a glass of water when his PHONE RINGS, the sound cutting through the quiet like a blade.

**RUMI**  
(checking phone)  
Unknown number... at this hour?

He hesitates, then answers.

**RUMI**  
Hello?

**POLICE OFFICER (V.O.)**  
(official tone)  
Am I speaking to Rumi Bin Imran?

**RUMI**  
(suddenly alert)  
Yes... who is this?

**POLICE OFFICER (V.O.)**  
Sir, we're calling from Shyamoli Square. There's been a car accident.

Rumi's face drains of color. His hand grips the counter.

**RUMI**  
And?

**POLICE OFFICER (V.O.)**  
(gentler)  
We found a deceased individual. We believe it's your wife.

The glass slips from Rumi's hand, SHATTERING on the floor.

### INT. LAB AID HOSPITAL - MORGUE - NIGHT (3:23 AM)

Sterile fluorescent lights buzz overhead. Rumi stands frozen before a covered body on a gurney. A POLICE OFFICER nods to the MEDICAL EXAMINER, who slowly pulls back the sheet.

Rumi's knees buckle. It's JANNAT (22), his wife, her face peaceful but lifeless.

**RUMI**  
(whispering)  
No... no, this can't be...

He reaches out with trembling fingers to touch her hand.

**RUMI**  
(breaking down)  
She was supposed to come home tonight... we were going to... we were going to...

His words dissolve into sobs. The room spins. He collapses.

### INT. RUMI'S FATHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING (8:40 AM)

Rumi jolts awake on an unfamiliar bed. His FATHER (55) sits nearby, weathered face etched with concern.

**RUMI**  
(panicked)  
Baba, where's Jannat? Where is she?

His father's silence speaks volumes. The terrible reality crashes back.

**RUMI**  
(screaming)  
NO! She can't be gone! She can't be!

He breaks down completely, his father holding him as he sobs.

---

## ACT II: THREE YEARS LATER

### TITLE CARD: "THREE YEARS LATER"

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING (6:40 PM)
*April 3, 2025*

The same house, but hollow now. RUMI (27) sits motionless on the sofa, still in his work clothes. The furniture remains unchanged, but everything feels like a museum to the dead.

He stares at a framed photo of him and Jannat on their wedding day. Her smile seems to mock his emptiness.

**RUMI**  
(to the photo)  
Three years, Jannat. Three years and I still can't... I can't let you go.

He sets down the photo and rises, mechanical in his movements.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Rumi prepares tea with practiced routine. He places the kettle and TWO cups on a tray - an old habit he can't break.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (6:51 PM)

Rumi sets the tray on the coffee table and begins pouring tea into one cup. He reaches for biscuits.

**RUMI**  
Almost forgot the—

A LOUD CRASH. He spins around. The kettle lies on the floor, tea spreading everywhere. A shadow moves past the window.

**RUMI**  
(startled)  
How did that happen?

He approaches the window cautiously, peering through the curtains.

**FADE TO BLACK - END OF SHARED ACTS**

# THE ECHO OF HER
## BRANCH TRANSITION ACTS

## BRANCH 2: THE UNEXPECTED VISITOR
### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (7:40 PM)

**RUMI**  
(calling toward the window)  
Who's there?

A figure steps into the porch light - DR. MARZIA RAHMAN (26), Rumi's childhood friend and personal physician. But something's off about her appearance. She's disheveled, breathing heavily, and there's a nervous energy about her that's unusual.

**MARZIA**  
(climbing through the window with forced cheerfulness)  
Sorry! Didn't mean to scare you. I knocked on the front door but you didn't answer.

**RUMI**  
(confused and slightly annoyed)  
Marzia? You nearly gave me a heart attack. Why didn't you just call first?

**MARZIA**  
(forced laugh)  
You know how you get on difficult days. I was worried you might not pick up.

She surveys the mess in the living room - the spilled tea, the overturned kettle.

**MARZIA**  
What happened here?

**RUMI**  
I was making tea when I heard something outside. The whole setup just... fell over.

**MARZIA**  
(too quickly)  
Probably the wind. It's picking up out there.

But Rumi notices the windows were closed. How could wind have caused this?

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (8:00 PM)

As Marzia helps clean up the mess, Rumi observes her more carefully. Her hands are trembling slightly, and she keeps glancing toward the windows.

**RUMI**  
You seem nervous tonight. Everything okay at the hospital?

**MARZIA**  
(defensive)  
I'm fine. Just tired. Long shift.

**RUMI**  
It's Thursday. You don't usually work Thursdays.

A pause. Marzia's cleaning slows.

**MARZIA**  
(recovering)  
Emergency call-in. Dr. Hassan was sick.

But Rumi knows Dr. Hassan retired last month. He mentioned it to Marzia himself.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (8:15 PM)

The atmosphere grows tense. Marzia's explanations aren't adding up, and both of them know it.

**RUMI**  
Marzia, how long were you outside before you knocked?

**MARZIA**  
(too casually)  
Just a few minutes. I was checking to see if your lights were on.

**RUMI**  
From outside the window? Not from the front of the house?

She doesn't answer immediately, focusing intently on folding a dish towel.

**MARZIA**  
I thought I saw you through the window and didn't want to disturb you if you were resting.

**RUMI**  
But you just said I wasn't answering the front door.

The contradiction hangs in the air between them. Marzia sets down the towel with deliberate care.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (8:30 PM)

**MARZIA**  
(changing subject)  
How are you feeling today? I know anniversaries can be... difficult.

**RUMI**  
I'm managing.

**MARZIA**  
Have you been taking your medication regularly?

**RUMI**  
Yes.

**MARZIA**  
All of it? The mood stabilizers and the memory supplements?

Memory supplements. That's what she calls them. But Rumi has never been entirely clear on why he needs medication to help with memory. His grief, yes. His sleep, yes. But memory?

**RUMI**  
Marzia, why do I take medication for memory?

**MARZIA**  
(clinical tone)  
Trauma can cause memory fragmentation. The medication helps prevent intrusive flashbacks and false memories from forming.

**RUMI**  
False memories of what?

**MARZIA**  
(pause)  
Of things that might have been different. Ways you might have saved her. Your mind sometimes creates scenarios that didn't happen.

But something in her tone suggests she's not telling him everything.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (8:45 PM)

The conversation has reached a turning point. Both Rumi and Marzia seem to be waiting for the other to reveal something.

**RUMI**  
I've been having strange dreams lately.

**MARZIA**  
(alert)  
What kind of dreams?

**RUMI**  
About that night. About things I can't quite remember.

Marzia reaches for her medical bag - she always carries it when visiting him.

**MARZIA**  
Maybe we should adjust your dosage. Increase the memory stabilizers.

**RUMI**  
Or maybe I should stop taking them altogether. See what I remember.

The suggestion clearly alarms her.

**MARZIA**  
That would be very dangerous, Rumi. Some memories are suppressed for good reasons.

*[BRANCH POINT: This conversation leads to either 2.1 or 2.2 depending on whose truth is revealed]*

## BRANCH 2.1: THE PERFECT CRIME UNRAVELS

## FADE IN:

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING (7:40 PM)
*April 3, 2025*

RUMI (27) approaches the window cautiously. The kettle lies on the floor, tea everywhere. He peers through the glass and sees a figure standing outside.

**RUMI**  
(calling out)  
Who's there?

The figure steps into the light - DR. MARZIA RAHMAN (26), his childhood friend. She appears disheveled, breathing heavily.

**MARZIA**  
(forcing a laugh, jumping through window)  
Have you lost it or something?

**RUMI**  
(angrily)  
You nearly gave me a heart attack!

**MARZIA**  
You're still scared of ghosts, aren't you? Grow up - you're twenty-seven, not seven, kiddo.

**RUMI**  
(pointing at mess)  
This was you, wasn't it?

**MARZIA**  
(too enthusiastic)  
Bullseye!

Rumi hands her a mop.

**RUMI**  
You're not leaving until that's clean.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (8:15 PM)

While Marzia cleans, Rumi watches her with growing suspicion.

**MARZIA**  
What's wrong? You look like you've seen a ghost.

**RUMI**  
Marzia, why were you outside my window? How long were you watching me?

Marzia pauses mid-cleaning.

**MARZIA**  
I... I was worried about you. Today marks three years since...

**RUMI**  
Since the accident. But that doesn't explain why you were hiding outside instead of knocking.

He notices a fresh scratch on her hand.

**RUMI**  
How did you get that scratch?

**MARZIA**  
(instinctively hiding hand)  
Oh, this? Clumsy run-in with a file cabinet at the clinic. It's nothing.

**RUMI**  
(studying window frame)  
Funny. There's a nail sticking out of that window frame you were looking through. Just the right height.

Marzia's nervous laugh dies in her throat.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (8:30 PM)

The atmosphere grows tense. Rumi serves tea, but his movements are calculated, watchful.

**RUMI**  
I was on the phone with the police earlier today. Just a follow-up call.

**MARZIA**  
(trying to appear casual)  
Oh? About what?

**RUMI**  
They told me something interesting. The case was never officially closed. Recently, they received an anonymous tip about another car being seen near Shyamoli Square that night.

The color drains from Marzia's face.

**MARZIA**  
That's impossible. It was a deserted road. It was raining. No one was there.

The words hang in the air like a death sentence.

**RUMI**  
(voice dropping to whisper)  
How would you know no one was there, Marzia? The police report said you were on call at the hospital all night.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (9:15 PM)

**MARZIA**  
(forcing smile)  
Rumi, you're not making sense. The grief is making you paranoid. Maybe you should take your medication.

**RUMI**  
Maybe I should call Detective Hassan right now. Ask him about that anonymous tip.

Marzia's mask begins to slip. Her hands tremble as she sets down her teacup.

**MARZIA**  
You don't want to do that, Rumi.

**RUMI**  
Why not? What are you afraid they'll find?

**MARZIA**  
(voice changing, becoming colder)  
I'm not afraid of anything. But you should be.

She stands slowly, reaching into her large handbag by the door.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (9:45 PM)

The charade is over. Marzia's expression shifts completely - the caring friend melting away to reveal something predatory and cold.

**MARZIA**  
(chilling smile)  
You were always smarter than she was.

**RUMI**  
(standing)  
What did you just say?

**MARZIA**  
Yes, I was there. I followed her. I watched her die. And I'm the one who made sure she died.

**RUMI**  
(barely breathing)  
You killed her.

**MARZIA**  
(voice dripping venom)  
I corrected a cosmic error! I loved you! While you were wasting your life on her, I was building a career, making myself worthy of you!

She pulls a blood-stained tire iron from her bag.

**MARZIA**  
She was a placeholder, and her time was up.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (10:15 PM)

Rumi subtly places his phone on the armrest, activating the voice recorder as Marzia continues her confession with horrifying pride.

**MARZIA**  
I lured her to the hospital parking garage. Told her I needed to give her a prenatal checkup.

**RUMI**  
(shocked)  
Prenatal?

**MARZIA**  
(theatrical gasp)  
Oh, did I forget to mention? She was pregnant, Rumi. Three months. She was going to tell you that night. She was carrying your son.

Rumi feels the world collapse beneath him.

**MARZIA**  
I couldn't let her have that. So I took this tire iron to her head. I destroyed her beautiful face so you would forget her faster.

She caresses the weapon lovingly.

**MARZIA**  
Then I drove her to Shyamoli Square and staged the crash. I am the author of your freedom, Rumi.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (10:50 PM)

**MARZIA**  
(moving toward door)  
The pills I gave you weren't just for grief. They were to keep you in a fog. To keep you dependent. To keep you mine.

She raises the tire iron menacingly.

**MARZIA**  
I kept this as evidence of my devotion. I wanted it here tonight when you finally understood everything I've done for you.

**RUMI**  
(backing away)  
You're insane.

**MARZIA**  
(screaming)  
I'M DEVOTED! And now you will finally thank me!

She lunges. Rumi throws a heavy glass tabletop, shattering it at her feet and making her stumble.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS (11:25 PM)

Blinded by pain, Marzia swings the tire iron wildly, connecting with Rumi's ribs. He crashes into the refrigerator, gasping as something cracks inside his chest.

**MARZIA**
(voice guttural through ruined lips)
I'll kill you slowly! I'll peel the skin from your bones the way you've peeled it from my face!

She corners him, raising the tire iron for a killing blow. Rumi sees Jannat's face in his mind - alive, smiling, carrying the child he never knew existed. With desperate strength, he grabs a heavy cast iron pan.

The impact is sickening. The pan connects with Marzia's jaw, shattering it on contact. Blood and teeth spray across the kitchen tiles.

**MARZIA**
(choking on bone fragments)
We... belong... together...

Neighbors have called police - sirens wail in the distance. Marzia advances on raw determination, face boiled, jaw shattered.

**RUMI**
(cornered, breaking chair leg)
It's over, Marzia!

As she lunges one final time, he drives the splintered wood upward, catching her under the chin. It penetrates through her throat.

Blood fountains between them. Her eyes go wide with shock. The tire iron falls with a clatter.

**MARZIA**
(dying whisper)
I... only... wanted... you...

She collapses forward, dead.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS (11:45 PM)

Police burst through the front door, finding a nightmare scene. The kitchen is painted in blood and viscera. Marzia lies face-down in a crimson pool, chair leg protruding from her throat.

Rumi sits against the wall, clutching broken ribs, phone in trembling hand - the audio recording still playing.

**RUMI**
(simply)
She killed my wife. She killed my baby.

**POLICE OFFICER**
Sir, we need you to put your hands where we can see them.

**RUMI**
(complying)
The recording has her confession. Check her apartment - she kept evidence.

### INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAWN (6:00 AM)

Rumi lies in a hospital bed as DETECTIVE HASSAN (40s) sits nearby with a notepad.

**DETECTIVE HASSAN**
The audio recording corroborates everything. We searched Dr. Rahman's apartment and found... disturbing evidence.

**RUMI**
What kind of evidence?

**DETECTIVE HASSAN**
Journals documenting her obsession with you dating back years. Photos of you she'd stolen. Medical records showing unauthorized prescriptions. And a lock box.

The detective pauses, clearly disturbed.

**DETECTIVE HASSAN**
Inside we found the original tire iron, still bearing traces of your wife's blood. Photos she took of the crime scene as trophies. And a prenatal ultrasound with your wife's name - with "OBSTACLE ELIMINATED" written across it in red ink.

**RUMI**
(closing eyes)
So it's over.

**DETECTIVE HASSAN**
We're reopening your wife's case. We'll exhume the body for proper autopsy. Given the evidence, it's clear you acted in self-defense tonight.

### EXT. CEMETERY - DAY (One Week Later)

News vans line the street. Headlines visible on newspapers: "DOCTOR'S DEADLY OBSESSION" and "MURDERED PREGNANT WIFE, DRUGGED HUSBAND FOR YEARS."

Rumi stands alone at Jannat's grave, ignoring the media circus.

**RUMI**
(to gravestone)
I know the truth now. All of it. About the baby, about what she did to you, about the three years of lies.

He places a small bouquet of jasmine flowers on the grave.

**RUMI**
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you. I'm sorry I never knew about our child.

### EXT. CEMETERY - CONTINUOUS (Three Months Later)

The media has moved on. Rumi stands beside two graves now - Jannat's and a smaller one reading "Baby Bin Imran - Never Born But Always Loved." He places tiny baby shoes on the small mound.

**RUMI**
The truth is out now. She can't hurt anyone anymore. The whole world knows what she did.

As he turns to leave, he feels a gentle warmth, like being embraced by sunlight. The scent of jasmine fills the air momentarily.

For a brief moment, he sees them - Jannat, whole and healthy, holding a small child with his eyes. They don't speak but smile at him before fading into the light of the setting sun.

**RUMI**
(whisper)
Rest now. Both of you.

For the first time in three years, the echo of her voice in his mind isn't filled with questions or pain. It's a gentle whisper of peace, of closure, of love that transcends death.

Rumi walks to his car with steady steps. He has a life to rebuild, a truth to honor, and a future to face - not with the numbing fog of manipulation, but with the clarity that comes from finally knowing the whole, terrible truth.

The echo of her love will always be with him, but now it comforts rather than haunts.

**FADE TO BLACK.**

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (7:40 PM)

**RUMI**  
(calling toward the window)  
Who's there?

A figure steps into the porch light - DR. MARZIA RAHMAN (26), Rumi's childhood friend and personal physician. She appears concerned but slightly out of breath.

**MARZIA**  
(climbing through window)  
Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. I knocked on the front door but got no answer.

## BRANCH 2 DECISION: Rumi calls out to the window

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (7:40 PM)

**RUMI**  
(calling toward the window)  
Who's there?

The figure steps into the light - DR. MARZIA RAHMAN (26), his childhood friend and doctor. She appears concerned but slightly out of breath.

**MARZIA**  
(climbing through window)  
Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. I knocked on the front door but got no answer.

**RUMI**  
(confused)  
Marzia? What are you doing here so late?

**MARZIA**  
I was worried. Today is... well, you know what day it is.

She notices the spilled tea and broken kettle on the floor.

**MARZIA**  
What happened here?

**RUMI**  
I... I'm not sure. I was making tea and then... I think I heard something outside.

Marzia studies his face with clinical concern.

**MARZIA**  
Rumi, have you been taking your medication?

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (8:15 PM)

As Marzia helps clean up the mess, Rumi sits on the sofa, looking distant and confused.

**MARZIA**  
(concerned)  
You're having one of your episodes again, aren't you? You seem disoriented.

**RUMI**  
(hollow voice)  
I'm fine. Just tired.

**MARZIA**  
It's the anniversary. It's understandable that today would be difficult for you.

She moves to her medical bag, retrieving a pill bottle.

**MARZIA**  
But you need to take your medication, Rumi. It helps keep the bad memories from overwhelming you.

**RUMI**  
(frowning, memory gaps troubling him)  
Marzia, that night... the night of the accident. I was home, right?

**MARZIA**  
(voice slightly too quick)  
Yes, of course. You were here, asleep. The police called you, then you called me in a panic.

**RUMI**  
I remember the morgue. But everything before that is... blank.

**MARIZA**  
(handing him pills and water)  
It's a trauma response. Your mind is protecting you from the pain.

As Rumi swallows the pills, a troubling thought surfaces: What kind of pain needs this much protection?

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (9:00 PM)

As Marzia prepares his medication, Rumi stares at the black television screen. In the reflection, his face looks distorted. For a moment, he sees another image - his own face, contorted with rage.

**RUMI**
(suddenly)
Marzia, that night... the night of the accident. I was home, right? You came and got me.

**MARZIA**
(voice slightly too quick)
Yes, of course. You were here, asleep. The police called you, then you called me in a panic. I drove you to the hospital.

**RUMI**
I remember the morgue. But everything before that is... blank. A fog.

**MARZIA**
(handing him pills and water)
It's a trauma response. Your mind is protecting you from the pain. It's for the best.

As he swallows the pills, a rogue thought surfaces: Protecting me from what? The pain of loss, or the pain of knowledge?

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (9:45 PM)

They watch television in near silence. A news report about domestic violence catches Rumi's attention - a man who killed his wife upon discovering her affair.

Suddenly, an image flashes in Rumi's mind, vivid and terrifying. JANNAT standing in their bedroom, her face defiant.

**JANNAT (MEMORY)**
(screaming)
Yes, I love him! And I'm pregnant with his child!

Another flash - the heavy feel of a sledgehammer from his toolbox. The sickening crunch of bone. Blood spraying across floral wallpaper.

**RUMI**
(gasping)
The wallpaper.

**MARZIA**
(sharp with alarm)
Rumi? What is it? You're pale as a sheet.

**RUMI**
(staring at living room wall)
We painted over the wallpaper in the bedroom. Why did we do that?

**MARZIA**
(eyes darting nervously)
It was old. You wanted a change after... after she was gone. To help you move on.

**RUMI**
(standing up)
No. We painted it to cover the bloodstains.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS (10:30 PM)

Rumi stumbles toward the bedroom, Marzia following, pleading with him.

**MARZIA**
Rumi, you're not thinking clearly! You're having a psychotic break!

He ignores her, going to the closet, digging until his hand closes around a sledgehammer handle. The memories flood back like a dam bursting.

Coming home early. Jannat with another man in their bed. The confession of the affair, the baby that wasn't his. The blinding, consuming rage.

**RUMI**
(choked whisper, turning to face Marzia)
I didn't just kill her. I killed him too. What did we do with his body, Marzia?

**MARZIA**
(face crumpling, lie no longer sustainable)
We staged it. Her on the street, him in J-Block. I helped you. You weren't... you weren't yourself.

**RUMI**
I did it to protect you!

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS (11:00 PM)

The final, awful truth settles between them like a poisonous cloud.

**RUMI**
(knuckles white on sledgehammer handle)
You let me believe I was a victim.

**MARZIA**
(sobbing)
I love you! I've always loved you. I couldn't let them send you to prison!

In her desperate, twisted love, he sees a mirror of his own possessive rage that led to murder.

**MARZIA**
I did what I had to do!

**RUMI**
You didn't want me to heal. You wanted me broken so you could hold the pieces together.

She reaches for a syringe in her medical bag.

**MARZIA**
What now, Rumi? We can go on as we have. I can increase the dosage. You can forget again.

He looks from the syringe to the sledgehammer. Forgetfulness was a prison. Truth was a death sentence. But it was his truth.

**RUMI**
No more lies.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS (11:15 PM)

**MARZIA**
(panicked)
Please, Rumi. Think about what you're doing. We've kept this secret for three years. We can keep it forever.

The sledgehammer feels impossibly heavy - not just from its weight, but from the memories it carries.

**RUMI**
(more to himself)
I killed them both. I came home early. I heard them in our bedroom...

**FLASHBACK - BEDROOM - NIGHT (March 13, 2022)**

*Younger Rumi opens the bedroom door. JANNAT (22) and a MAN (30s) are in bed together. They freeze, caught.*

**JANNAT (FLASHBACK)**
Rumi! I can explain—

**RUMI (FLASHBACK)**
(voice shaking with rage)
How long?

**JANNAT (FLASHBACK)**
(climbing out of bed)
Six months. I'm pregnant, Rumi. It's his child.

**MAN (FLASHBACK)**
(standing)
Look, man, we didn't mean for you to find out this way—

*Past-Rumi disappears, returning with the sledgehammer.*

**JANNAT (FLASHBACK)**
(pleading)
Rumi, please! We can work this out!

*The first swing takes the man in the temple. He drops instantly.*

**JANNAT (FLASHBACK)**
(screaming, running)
NO! RUMI, NO!

*He catches her in the hallway. The second swing ends her screams forever.*

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - PRESENT (11:30 PM)

**RUMI**
(tears streaming)
She told me she was pregnant with his child. That they were starting a new life together.

**MARZIA**
(step toward him)
She betrayed you. She deserved what she got.

**RUMI**
(sharp accusation)
And what did you deserve, Marzia? You didn't call the police. You didn't try to stop me. You helped me. Why?

**MARZIA**
(complex emotion - devotion and possession)
Because I've loved you since we were children. I watched you waste that love on her, and she repaid you with betrayal.

**RUMI**
So you saw an opportunity.

**MARZIA**
I saw a chance to save you! I knew how to make it look like an accident. I knew how to help you forget.

**RUMI**
(bitter laugh)
You didn't want me to forget to heal me. You wanted me to forget so I'd be dependent on you.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS (11:50 PM)

**RUMI**
What did we do with their bodies? Tell me everything. No more sedatives, no more half-truths.

Marzia's professional demeanor crumbles. Her hands shake as she begins to speak.

**MARZIA**
You killed them both in here. He died first - one blow to the temple. But Jannat... she tried to run. You caught her in the hallway.

Her clinical detachment returns as she recounts the details.

**MARZIA**
Multiple blunt force traumas to the cranium. Catastrophic brain injury. Death was immediate.

**RUMI**
And then I called you.

**MARZIA**
You were incoherent. Covered in blood. I came immediately. I knew what to do.

A flicker of pride crosses her features.

**MARZIA**
I cleaned you up first. Then we wrapped his body in plastic from the garage. Put him in my car trunk.

**RUMI**
And Jannat?

**MARZIA**
We made it look like she'd been in his car. Like they were running away together and crashed. I used my medical knowledge to ensure the injuries matched a high-speed collision.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (12:15 AM)

*April 4, 2025*

Rumi sinks onto the sofa, sledgehammer sliding from his grip. The full weight of his actions crushes down on him.

**RUMI**
I'm not a grieving widower. I'm a murderer.

**MARZIA**
(desperate)
We can increase your medication. You can forget again. We can move away, start fresh.

**RUMI**
Did you ever feel guilt? Even once in three years?

**MARZIA**
Guilt? For what? For protecting you? For loving you enough to save you from yourself?

In that moment, Rumi sees her clearly - not as his friend or caretaker, but as someone whose love had mutated into monstrous possession.

**RUMI**
(quietly, reaching for phone)
I'm calling the police.

**MARZIA**
(lunging, knocking phone away)
You can't! I won't let you throw everything away!

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (12:30 AM)

The struggle is brief but violent. Marzia fights with desperate strength, clawing at his face, screaming about sacrifice and devotion.

When she reaches for the fallen sledgehammer, something in Rumi snaps.

He doesn't remember grabbing her throat. Doesn't remember squeezing until her eyes bulge and face turns purple. Doesn't remember the crack as her trachea collapses.

When awareness returns, Marzia lies motionless, eyes fixed on the ceiling. Her medical bag is spilled - pills, syringes, and the fiction of his innocence scattered like confetti.

Rumi stares at what he's done, then picks up his phone with mechanical precision.

**RUMI**
(dialing)
Emergency services.

**OPERATOR (V.O.)**
Emergency services.

**RUMI**
(voice steady)
I need to report a murder. Three murders, actually.

### INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAWN (6:00 AM)

Dawn breaks through the windows. Rumi has been talking for hours, his voice raw from confession. DETECTIVE HASSAN sits across from him, recording everything.

The evidence supports his story. In Marzia's apartment, they find journals documenting her childhood obsession with Rumi. Medical records showing unauthorized prescriptions. A lock box containing trophies - Jannat's wedding ring, a blood-stained shirt, secret photos from the crime scene.

**DETECTIVE HASSAN**
(reading him rights)
Rumi Bin Imran, you're under arrest for three counts of homicide...

As morning light strengthens, Rumi feels neither relief nor redemption. Justice is being served, but it cannot resurrect the dead.

### INT. PRISON CELL - DAY (Weeks Later)

The cell is small, sterile. Rumi sits on the narrow cot, alone with his memories at last.

For three years, he lived a lie constructed by toxic devotion. Now, facing consequences, he's finally free from manipulation, false memories, and the drugs that kept him prisoner in his own mind.

**RUMI**
(to himself)
The truth of what I did will haunt me until I die. But the truth is better than the comfortable lie.

He thinks of Jannat - not as she was in death, but alive, laughing, real. Her voice will follow him into old age, into whatever afterlife awaits. But now it's her true voice he hears - not the distorted whisper planted in his drugged mind.

The cell door is locked, but for the first time in three years, there are no more lies. The monster he discovered is terrible to behold, but at least now he faces it with clear eyes.

**RUMI**
(whisper)
No more lies.

**FADE TO BLACK.**

**THE END**
