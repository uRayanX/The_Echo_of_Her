## ACT I: THE AWAKENING

### FADE IN:

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT (2:57 AM)
*March 14, 2022*

RUMI BIN IMRAN (24), disheveled and groggy, stumbles through his modest home. The silence is oppressive. He reaches for a glass of water when his PHONE RINGS, the sound cutting through the quiet like a blade.

**RUMI**  
(checking phone)  
- **Option A:** Unknown number... at this hour?
- **Option B:** Who could be calling this late?

He hesitates, then answers.

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** Hello?
- **Option B:** Yes, this is Rumi speaking.

**POLICE OFFICER (V.O.)**  
(official tone)  
Am I speaking to Rumi Bin Imran?

**RUMI**  
(suddenly alert)  
- **Option A:** Yes... who is this?
- **Option B:** Speaking. What's happened?

**POLICE OFFICER (V.O.)**  
Sir, we're calling from Shyamoli Square. There's been a car accident.

Rumi's face drains of color. His hand grips the counter.

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** And?
- **Option B:** Tell me everything. Now.

**POLICE OFFICER (V.O.)**  
(gentler)  
We found a deceased individual. We believe it's your wife.

The glass slips from Rumi's hand, SHATTERING on the floor.

---

### INT. LAB AID HOSPITAL - MORGUE - NIGHT (3:23 AM)

Sterile fluorescent lights buzz overhead. Rumi stands frozen before a covered body on a gurney. A POLICE OFFICER nods to the MEDICAL EXAMINER, who slowly pulls back the sheet.

Rumi's knees buckle. It's JANNAT (22), his wife, her face peaceful but lifeless.

**RUMI**  
(whispering)  
- **Option A:** No... no, this can't be...
- **Option B:** There must be some mistake... this isn't her...

He reaches out with trembling fingers to touch her hand.

**RUMI**  
(breaking down)  
- **Option A:** She was supposed to come home tonight... we were going to... we were going to...
- **Option B:** We had plans for tomorrow... I was waiting up for her... she promised...

His words dissolve into sobs. The room spins. He collapses.

---

### INT. RUMI'S FATHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING (8:40 AM)

Rumi jolts awake on an unfamiliar bed. His FATHER (55) sits nearby, weathered face etched with concern.

**RUMI**  
(panicked)  
- **Option A:** Baba, where's Jannat? Where is she?
- **Option B:** Father, please tell me it was just a nightmare. Where is she?

His father's silence speaks volumes. The terrible reality crashes back.

**RUMI**  
(screaming)  
- **Option A:** NO! She can't be gone! She can't be!
- **Option B:** This isn't happening! Tell me this isn't real!

He breaks down completely, his father holding him as he sobs.

---

## ACT II: THREE YEARS LATER

### TITLE CARD: "THREE YEARS LATER"

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING (6:40 PM)
*April 3, 2025*

The same house, but hollow now. RUMI (27) sits motionless on the sofa, still in his work clothes. The furniture remains unchanged, but everything feels like a museum to the dead.

He stares at a framed photo of him and Jannat on their wedding day. Her smile seems to mock his emptiness.

**RUMI**  
(to the photo)  
- **Option A:** Three years, Jannat. Three years and I still can't... I can't let you go.
- **Option B:** It's been three years, and the pain hasn't dulled even a little. I miss you so much.

He sets down the photo and rises, mechanical in his movements.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Rumi prepares tea with practiced routine. He places the kettle and TWO cups on a tray - an old habit he can't break.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (6:51 PM)

Rumi sets the tray on the coffee table and begins pouring tea into one cup. He reaches for biscuits.

**RUMI**  
Almost forgot theâ€”

A LOUD CRASH. He spins around. The kettle lies on the floor, tea spreading everywhere. A shadow moves past the window.

**RUMI**  
(startled)  
- **Option A:** How did that happen?
- **Option B:** What the hell...?

He approaches the window cautiously, peering through the curtains.

**FADE TO BLACK - END OF SHARED ACTS**

# BRANCH 1: THE CAT INCIDENT

## SUB-BRANCH 1.1: THE SUPPRESSED MEMORY

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (7:40 PM)

Rumi goes closer to the window and realizes the windows are closed, which is strange - he thought they were open. The curtains are swaying from wind outside.

As he opens the window, a CAT suddenly jumps out from behind the curtains and runs away into the night.

**RUMI**  
(startled, then relieved)  
- **Option A:** Crikey... just a cat.
- **Option B:** Damn it... scared the hell out of me.

He looks at the mess - the plastic kettle on the floor, tea everywhere. Surprisingly, the kettle isn't cracked despite the fall.

**RUMI**  
(to himself)  
- **Option A:** Huh. Didn't realize this thing was so durable. Five years and still going strong.
- **Option B:** That's odd... it should've cracked from that fall. Lucky, I guess.

He goes to get a mop and cleans up the spill. By the time he's done, his mood for tea has completely evaporated.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT (8:30 PM)

Rumi sits alone at the dining table with a simple meal - rice and vegetable curry. The silence in the house feels heavier tonight, more oppressive than usual.

He eats mechanically, lost in thought, occasionally glancing at the empty chair across from him where Jannat used to sit.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (9:00 PM)

Rumi settles in to watch TV, but the screen keeps flickering badly - much worse than the usual satellite issues. Static cuts through the picture every few seconds.

He goes to check the window and notices it's pouring rain outside. Heavy sheets of water cascade down the glass.

**RUMI**  
(surprised)  
- **Option A:** When did that start? I didn't even hear it begin.
- **Option B:** Strange... it was clear just a moment ago.

The storm seems to have come out of nowhere. Lightning flashes, illuminating the empty street.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT (10:10 PM)

The rain pounds against the windows with increasing intensity. Rumi lies in bed, unable to sleep despite his exhaustion. The room feels unusually cold for April.

Thunder RUMBLES overhead, growing closer. Each flash of lightning throws strange shadows across the walls.

**RUMI**  
(pulling blankets tighter)  
- **Option A:** Storm came out of nowhere...
- **Option B:** This weather is completely wrong for this time of year...

A particularly loud CRASH of thunder makes him jump. But then he realizes - that sound came from inside the house.

**RUMI**  
(sitting up)  
- **Option A:** What the hell?
- **Option B:** Not again... what now?

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Rumi enters to find the impossible - the exact same scene as hours before. The kettle on the floor, tea everywhere, windows blown open by wind and rain.

**RUMI**  
(backing away, frightened)  
- **Option A:** This is impossible... this happened hours ago... I cleaned this up...
- **Option B:** I already fixed this... how is this happening again?

The wind howls through the opening, but there's something wrong with the sound - it's too deliberate, too purposeful.

**JANNAT (O.S.)**  
(gentle voice)  
Keep them open. The weather feels nice and cozy.

Rumi freezes. The voice he's longed to hear for three years, but hasn't heard since that terrible night.

**RUMI**  
(whisper)  
- **Option A:** No... it can't be...
- **Option B:** Jannat? That's impossible...

He turns slowly. JANNAT (22) sits on the sofa, but she's wrong - horrifically wrong. Blood covers the right side of her face, her skull caved in, brain matter visible through shattered bone.

**JANNAT**  
(smiling sadly)  
You know I like rain, don't you?

**RUMI**  
(approaching cautiously)  
- **Option A:** Jannat? How... how are you here?
- **Option B:** This can't be real... you're dead...

He sits beside her, tears streaming down his face.

**RUMI**  
Hi.

**JANNAT**  
Look what you've done to me.

**RUMI**  
(shaking head frantically)  
- **Option A:** No. Marzia did this. It was Marzia in the car accident.
- **Option B:** I didn't do this. You died in a crash. It wasn't my fault.

**JANNAT**  
(hollow laugh)  
- **Option A:** Is that what you've told yourself for three years? Is that the lie you've been living?
- **Option B:** Three years of denial. Three years of believing the story she fed you.

The television flickers on by itself, showing static.

**JANNAT**  
Watch. Watch what you did to me.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - FLASHBACK (6:40 PM, March 13, 2022)

The static clears to reveal younger RUMI and JANNAT arguing violently. She's packing a suitcase.

**JANNAT (FLASHBACK)**  
- **Option A:** I can't do this anymore, Rumi. Your paranoia, your jealousy - it's destroying us. I need space.
- **Option B:** This has to stop. Your constant accusations, your suspicions - I can't breathe. I need to leave for a while.

**RUMI (FLASHBACK)**  
- **Option A:** You're leaving me for him, aren't you? For that doctor you work with?
- **Option B:** Don't lie to me! I know you're having an affair with Dr. Nabil!

**JANNAT (FLASHBACK)**  
- **Option A:** There's nothing between me and Dr. Nabil! This is exactly what I'm talking about - these delusions!
- **Option B:** For God's sake, he's my obstetrician! That's all! You're being irrational!

**RUMI (FLASHBACK)**  
LIAR!

He grabs her shoulders, shaking her violently.

**JANNAT (FLASHBACK)**  
(screaming)  
- **Option A:** Those texts were about our baby, you idiot! I'm pregnant! He's my obstetrician! I was going to surprise you on your birthday!
- **Option B:** Stop! Listen to me! I'm carrying your child! Dr. Nabil is helping me with the pregnancy! I was planning to tell you this weekend!

Rumi-present watches in horror as his past self leaves the room, returning with a hammer from his toolbox.

**RUMI**  
(present, backing away)  
- **Option A:** No... that's not what happened...
- **Option B:** Stop showing me this... this isn't real...

On screen, Past-Rumi brings the hammer down on Jannat's skull with savage force. The crunch of bone is sickeningly loud.

**JANNAT**  
(present, calmly)  
- **Option A:** You beat me to death. You beat our unborn child to death. And then you called Marzia to help you cover it up.
- **Option B:** Twelve blows to the head. You killed me and our baby. Then Marzia helped you stage the accident.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - PRESENT NIGHT

**RUMI**  
(collapsing)  
- **Option A:** I... I remember now. The blood. The sound when I...
- **Option B:** Oh God... it's all coming back... what have I done?

**JANNAT**  
- **Option A:** You killed two people that night, Rumi. Me and our son.
- **Option B:** A wife and an unborn child. That's what your jealous rage cost.

**RUMI**  
(sobbing)  
- **Option A:** What have I done? What have I become?
- **Option B:** I'm a monster... I killed you... I killed our baby...

The television shows more footage - MARZIA arriving, helping to clean up, staging the car accident.

**JANNAT**  
- **Option A:** She's been medicating you for three years. Not for grief - to control your violent episodes. To keep you from remembering what you did.
- **Option B:** Every pill she gave you was designed to suppress the truth. To keep you docile and forgetful.

A KNOCK at the door.

**MARZIA (O.S.)**  
Rumi? Are you awake? I heard shouting.

**JANNAT**  
- **Option A:** She's here to keep the monster contained. The question is: what will you do with the truth?
- **Option B:** Your jailer has arrived. Will you submit to her control again, or will you face what you've done?

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (1:15 AM)

MARZIA enters with her medical bag, eyes widening at Rumi's state.

**MARZIA**  
- **Option A:** Rumi, you haven't been taking your medication, have you?
- **Option B:** Oh no... you stopped taking the pills, didn't you? How long has it been?

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** I remember everything, Marzia.
- **Option B:** The drugs are wearing off. I can see it all now.

Her face goes pale.

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** The hammer. The blood. The sound her skull made when I... I killed her. I killed my pregnant wife.
- **Option B:** I murdered Jannat. Beat her to death with a hammer while she begged for mercy. She was carrying my child.

**MARZIA**  
(gently)  
- **Option A:** You're having an episode, Rumi. Let me help you.
- **Option B:** These are false memories, Rumi. The trauma is creating delusions. Take your medication.

**RUMI**  
(roaring)  
- **Option A:** Stop LYING! I saw it! Jannat showed me the truth!
- **Option B:** NO MORE LIES! I remember what I did to her!

He points to where Jannat sits, but Marzia sees only empty space.

**MARZIA**  
(preparing syringe)  
- **Option A:** These delusions - you need your medication.
- **Option B:** Rumi, please. You're seeing things that aren't there. Let me help you.

**RUMI**  
(grabbing lamp, hurling it)  
- **Option A:** They're not delusions! I killed her because I thought she was cheating. But she wasn't. She was pregnant with my child.
- **Option B:** I murdered my wife! My pregnant wife! And you helped me hide it!

**MARZIA**  
(clinical demeanor cracking)  
- **Option A:** Yes. She was. And you've spent three years blocking it out because your mind couldn't handle the guilt.
- **Option B:** You're right. I helped you cover it up. I've been keeping you sedated so you wouldn't remember.

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** Without the medication, I remember the truth. That I'm a murderer. That you helped me cover it up.
- **Option B:** The fog is lifting. I can see clearly now. I killed her, and you made me forget.

**MARZIA**  
(tears streaming)  
- **Option A:** I had no choice. I loved you. I thought I could keep you stable, keep you from hurting anyone else.
- **Option B:** What was I supposed to do? Turn you in? I couldn't. So I've been managing you, controlling you, trying to keep you safe.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (1:45 AM)

**MARZIA**  
- **Option A:** I should have gone to the police. But I'd already helped move the body. I was complicit. So I convinced myself that keeping you medicated was the best I could do.
- **Option B:** The moment I helped you stage that accident, I became an accomplice. Prison or this - those were my choices.

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** All these years, I thought you were my friend.
- **Option B:** You pretended to care about me while you were really just my keeper.

**MARZIA**  
- **Option A:** I was your jailer. Your psychiatric nurse. Because you destroyed your conscience with the same hammer you used on Jannat's skull.
- **Option B:** I've been your warden for three years. Someone had to control the monster you became.

Rumi lunges at her, hands around her throat.

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** You should have let me face justice!
- **Option B:** I deserved prison! You had no right to decide!

**MARZIA**  
(choking)  
- **Option A:** Rumi, please - this isn't you, it's the illness!
- **Option B:** Stop... you're not a killer... don't prove me wrong...

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** No. This is exactly who I am. A murderer.
- **Option B:** I killed once. What's one more life?

**JANNAT**  
(appearing beside him)  
- **Option A:** This won't bring me back. This won't bring our baby back.
- **Option B:** More blood won't wash away your sins, Rumi.

Rumi's grip loosens. Marzia gasps for air.

**JANNAT**  
- **Option A:** She tried to help you, in her way. Killing her won't make things right.
- **Option B:** Her methods were wrong, but her intentions... Let her call the police. Face your punishment properly.

**RUMI**  
(releasing Marzia)  
- **Option A:** Get out. Get out and call the police. Tell them I'm confessing to the murder of Jannat.
- **Option B:** Leave. Now. And tell the authorities everything. I'm ready to face what I've done.

**MARZIA**  
(staggering)  
Rumi, you're not well-

**RUMI**  
(grabbing kitchen knife)  
- **Option A:** GET OUT! Call the police, or I swear I'll finish what I started.
- **Option B:** LEAVE! Bring the police or I won't be responsible for what happens next!

She flees. Rumi turns to Jannat's ghost.

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** What happens now?
- **Option B:** Is this what you wanted? Justice?

**JANNAT**  
- **Option A:** Now you face the truth.
- **Option B:** Now you pay for what you've done.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (2:30 AM)

Police sirens approach. Jannat's ghost moves closer.

**JANNAT**  
- **Option A:** They'll take you away. Prison, or a psychiatric facility. Is that justice enough?
- **Option B:** You'll spend years behind bars, or locked in a mental ward. Will that balance the scales?

Rumi looks at the knife in his hand.

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** No. It's not enough.
- **Option B:** Nothing could ever be enough. But I have to try.

**JANNAT**  
- **Option A:** What would be enough?
- **Option B:** Show me, then. Show me your remorse.

**RUMI**  
(raising knife)  
- **Option A:** The same pain I inflicted. The same destruction.
- **Option B:** Blood for blood. Pain for pain.

**JANNAT**  
Show me you understand what you did to me.

Rumi draws the blade across his forearm. Blood wells up.

**RUMI**  
(sobbing, cutting again)  
- **Option A:** I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...
- **Option B:** Forgive me... please forgive me...

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (2:45 AM)

Police break down the door to find Rumi on his knees in a pool of blood, arms ribboned with wounds.

**RUMI**  
(calmly to officers)  
- **Option A:** I killed my wife. Three years ago. I beat her to death with a hammer because I thought she was unfaithful. She was pregnant with my child.
- **Option B:** My name is Rumi Bin Imran. Three years ago, I murdered my pregnant wife in a fit of jealous rage. I'm ready to confess everything.

**POLICE OFFICER**  
Sir, you need medical attention.

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** No. I need to confess now.
- **Option B:** Let me bleed. I need to tell you what I did first.

As paramedics work to save him, Rumi recounts every detail. Throughout his confession, he looks to the corner where officers see nothing - but he sees Jannat, whole and unblemished, smiling sadly.

**RUMI**  
(to her)  
- **Option A:** I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- **Option B:** Can you ever forgive me?

### INT. PSYCHIATRIC WARD - DAY (Two Weeks Later)

The ward is sterile, devoid of sharp objects. Rumi's arms are heavily bandaged. MARZIA visits in her professional capacity, bruises still visible on her throat.

**MARZIA**  
The police found the hammer. Hidden in the attic, just where you said. The DNA evidence confirmed everything.

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** Will you be charged?
- **Option B:** What about you? What will happen to you?

**MARZIA**  
- **Option A:** Accessory after the fact. I'll lose my license. Serve some time.
- **Option B:** They're offering a plea deal. Reduced sentence in exchange for testimony. I'll never practice medicine again.

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** I'm sorry. For dragging you into this.
- **Option B:** None of this would have happened if I'd been a better man. I'm sorry.

**MARZIA**  
I made my own choices.

As she leaves, Rumi calls after her.

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** Do you think she can rest now? Now that the truth is known?
- **Option B:** Is Jannat at peace now? Does she know justice is being served?

**MARZIA**  
- **Option A:** Jannat is gone, Rumi. The only ghosts are the ones in your mind.
- **Option B:** There are no ghosts, Rumi. Only guilt. Only memories. And those will haunt you forever.

But as the door closes, Rumi feels her presence beside him. Jannat sits on his bed, whole and beautiful.

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** Are you still here to torment me?
- **Option B:** Why haven't you left? Haven't I suffered enough?

**JANNAT**  
- **Option A:** No. I'm here to help you heal. The truth is out. Justice is being served.
- **Option B:** I'm not here to punish you anymore. You're doing that well enough yourself.

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** Will you ever forgive me?
- **Option B:** Can someone like me even deserve forgiveness?

**JANNAT**  
(touching his cheek)  
- **Option A:** Forgiveness isn't what you need from me. You need to forgive yourself enough to face your illness, to get the help you've needed all along.
- **Option B:** I can't give you absolution. But I can tell you this: get real help. Face your demons. That's the only path forward.

**RUMI**  
And then?

**JANNAT**  
(beginning to fade)  
- **Option A:** You live with what you've done. You carry it. That's your sentence. That's your penance.
- **Option B:** Then you wake up every day and choose to be better than the monster you were. Every single day, for the rest of your life.

As she disappears into the sunlight, Rumi feels something shift - not peace, but perhaps the foundation upon which peace might someday be built.

The echo of her presence lingers, no longer an accusation but a reminder of the terrible truth he must never forget.

**FADE TO BLACK.**

**THE END - BRANCH 1.1**

---

## SUB-BRANCH 1.2: THE VENGEFUL SPIRIT

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (11:30 PM)

The impossible has happened. The exact same scene - kettle on the floor, tea everywhere, windows blown open by the wind.

**RUMI**  
(backing away, frightened)  
- **Option A:** This is impossible... this happened hours ago...
- **Option B:** I already cleaned this... what's happening?

The room grows frigidly cold. Frost begins forming on the windows despite the spring weather. His breath becomes visible in the suddenly arctic air.

**RUMI**  
(approaching window cautiously)  
- **Option A:** What the hell is going on?
- **Option B:** Something's very wrong here...

**JANNAT (O.S.)**  
(hollow, echoing voice)  
Keep them open. The weather feels nice and cozy.

Rumi freezes. The voice he's longed to hear, but wrong - distorted, otherworldly.

**RUMI**  
(turning slowly)  
- **Option A:** Jannat?
- **Option B:** That voice... it can't be...

JANNAT (22) sits on the sofa, but she's a nightmare version of his beloved wife. Her skull is partially caved in, brain matter visible through shattered bone, her neck bent at an unnatural angle.

**RUMI**  
(approaching cautiously)  
- **Option A:** Jannat? How... how are you here?
- **Option B:** You're dead... this isn't real...

**JANNAT**  
(hollow, echoing quality)  
- **Option A:** I've been waiting for you to see me, Rumi. Really see me.
- **Option B:** Three years I've waited in the darkness for you to open your eyes.

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** I don't understand. You died in a car accident.
- **Option B:** They said it was a crash. That you died instantly.

**JANNAT**  
- **Option A:** Did I? Or is that just what she wanted everyone to believe?
- **Option B:** Is that what Marzia told you? That I died in a simple accident?

The temperature drops further. The television flickers to life, showing static that gradually resolves into grainy security camera footage.

### SECURITY FOOTAGE - HOSPITAL PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT (March 14, 2022)

The timestamp shows the night Jannat died. JANNAT walks alone through the garage, distressed, on the phone.

**JANNAT (PRESENT)**  
(voice-over)  
- **Option A:** I was calling you. I had discovered something terrible about Marzia, and I was trying to warn you.
- **Option B:** I tried to reach you. I'd found evidence of what she was doing to you. But you never answered.

On screen, DR. MARZIA RAHMAN appears from behind, carrying something metallic.

**JANNAT (PRESENT)**  
- **Option A:** But you didn't answer.
- **Option B:** The phone rang and rang. And while it rang, she came for me.

The two women begin arguing. Suddenly, Marzia raises a tire iron and brings it down on Jannat's head with savage force.

**RUMI**  
(horrified)  
- **Option A:** What did you discover?
- **Option B:** What had she done? Tell me!

**JANNAT (PRESENT)**  
- **Option A:** She had been drugging you, Rumi. For months. Small doses that made you more susceptible to suggestion.
- **Option B:** Pills in your coffee. Powder in your food. Chemicals that made your mind malleable to her lies.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (12:15 AM)

The footage continues in gruesome detail. After dropping Jannat, Marzia doesn't stop. She continues beating Jannat's head, each strike more vicious.

**JANNAT**  
- **Option A:** She told me she had been slowly poisoning your mind against me. Planting doubts about my faithfulness so that when she struck, you would believe any story.
- **Option B:** For months she whispered in your ear. Showed you 'evidence' of affairs that never happened. Made you doubt everything about our love.

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** This is horrible. Why would she do this?
- **Option B:** Why? We were happy. We loved each other.

**JANNAT**  
- **Option A:** Because she discovered I was pregnant.
- **Option B:** Because I was carrying your child. The one thing she could never give you.

### TRAFFIC CAMERA FOOTAGE - SHYAMOLI SQUARE - LATER THAT NIGHT

The screen changes to show Marzia positioning Jannat's mutilated corpse behind the wheel.

**JANNAT**  
- **Option A:** I was awake for part of it. The first few blows didn't kill me immediately. I felt her dragging my body, felt the gravel scraping against my exposed brain tissue.
- **Option B:** Do you want to know the worst part? I was conscious. Paralyzed, but conscious. I felt everything she did to me afterward.

Marzia uses a sledgehammer to further destroy the car's interior and what remains of Jannat's skull.

**JANNAT**  
- **Option A:** She took a sledgehammer to what was left of my head. She wanted to make sure no one would ever tell that she had beaten me to death first.
- **Option B:** Twenty-three blows with that sledgehammer. I counted every one before I finally died.

**RUMI**  
(tears streaming)  
- **Option A:** Why? Why would she torture you like this?
- **Option B:** What kind of monster does this to an innocent person?

**JANNAT**  
- **Option A:** Because I was carrying your child, and she couldn't bear anyone else having the family she wanted with you.
- **Option B:** Jealousy. Obsession. Love twisted into something monstrous. Take your pick.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (12:45 AM)

Jannat's spirit becomes more solid. The room fills with jasmine mixed with metallic blood.

**JANNAT**  
- **Option A:** I had just found out that morning. I was so excited. I bought tiny baby shoes to surprise you when you came home.
- **Option B:** Three months pregnant. We were going to have a son. I'd already picked out names.

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** We were going to have a child?
- **Option B:** A baby? We were going to be parents?

**JANNAT**  
- **Option A:** But when I went to Marzia for a pregnancy checkup, she seemed devastated instead of happy. That's when I started putting pieces together.
- **Option B:** I showed her the positive test, expecting congratulations. Instead, I saw murder in her eyes.

She moves closer, her mangled face inches from his.

**JANNAT**  
- **Option A:** I realized she had been in love with you for years. Photos dating back to childhood, journals about you obsessively, detailed plans for eliminating obstacles.
- **Option B:** Her apartment was a shrine to you. Pictures from when you were children. Diary entries spanning decades. She'd been planning this for years.

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** She was planning this for a long time?
- **Option B:** All those years... she was obsessed with me?

**JANNAT**  
- **Option A:** For years. My pregnancy was the final trigger that pushed her over the edge.
- **Option B:** She was patient. Methodical. But a baby? That she couldn't tolerate.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (1:15 AM)

The front door opens. MARZIA'S voice calls out.

**MARZIA (O.S.)**  
Rumi? Are you awake? I brought your medication. I was worried about the storm.

**JANNAT**  
(urgent)  
- **Option A:** She's here. She's been coming every night since I died, making sure you stay medicated, stay compliant.
- **Option B:** Your keeper has arrived. Every night for three years, she's come to poison you.

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** Different how?
- **Option B:** What's changed? Why tonight?

**JANNAT**  
- **Option A:** Tonight is the three-year anniversary. She's not here to drug you. She's here to kill you the same way she killed me.
- **Option B:** Three years of waiting. Tonight, she finishes what she started. You die the way I died.

MARZIA appears in the doorway, but instead of her medical bag, she carries the same tire iron and a sledgehammer.

**MARZIA**  
(eerily calm)  
- **Option A:** Hello, Rumi. I see you're having trouble sleeping again.
- **Option B:** Still awake, my love? That's unfortunate. I was hoping you'd be unconscious for this.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (1:30 AM)

**MARZIA**  
- **Option A:** Three years is long enough to grieve, don't you think? Tonight, you join your beloved wife.
- **Option B:** I've been patient. I've given you time to love me. But you're still hers, aren't you? Time to fix that.

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** Marzia, what are you doing?
- **Option B:** Have you lost your mind? Put those down!

**MARZIA**  
- **Option A:** I gave you three years to fall in love with me. But you're still as obsessed with that dead bitch as the day I caved her skull in.
- **Option B:** Three years of devotion, and you still whisper her name in your sleep. I won't tolerate it anymore.

**JANNAT**  
(to Rumi)  
- **Option A:** She planned this from the beginning. Make you dependent for three years, then when you failed to love her, kill you the same brutal way.
- **Option B:** This was always her endgame. Keep you close until she couldn't anymore.

**MARZIA**  
- **Option A:** Just like I beat her to death. I'm going to crush your skull the same way, one savage blow at a time. But I'll make you last longer. She only took twelve hits to die. You're going to take twenty.
- **Option B:** I want you to experience what she felt. Every crack of bone. Every splinter of skull. Except you'll suffer longer.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (1:45 AM)

Marzia raises the sledgehammer.

**MARZIA**  
- **Option A:** I want you to know exactly how she died. I want you to experience every moment of agony I put her through.
- **Option B:** Each blow will be a lesson. In pain. In betrayal. In what happens when you reject my love.

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** You're insane.
- **Option B:** You're a monster!

**MARZIA**  
(swinging)  
- **Option A:** I'm in love! If I can't have you in life, then in death you'll be free from her memory!
- **Option B:** Love makes us do terrible things, Rumi! You should understand that better than anyone!

The hammer smashes into the wall as Rumi ducks. Suddenly, Jannat's spirit becomes corporeal, grabbing the sledgehammer handle.

**JANNAT**  
(solid, real)  
- **Option A:** Not if I have anything to say about it.
- **Option B:** You took my life. You won't take his.

Marzia staggers backward, shocked.

**MARZIA**  
- **Option A:** Impossible.
- **Option B:** No... you're dead... I killed you!

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (2:00 AM)

**JANNAT**  
- **Option A:** Three years of rage, three years of unfinished business. You think death is the end? You think murder goes unpunished?
- **Option B:** Did you really think I'd rest peacefully after what you did to me? To my child?

Jannat wrestles the sledgehammer away. Marzia pulls out the tire iron.

**MARZIA**  
- **Option A:** You're not real. You're just his grief-induced hallucination.
- **Option B:** Ghosts aren't real! You're a delusion! A trick of his broken mind!

**JANNAT**  
- **Option A:** Then why are you so afraid?
- **Option B:** If I'm not real, why is your hand shaking?

Jannat's spirit transforms, becoming more terrifying. Her wounds become more pronounced, brain matter dripping from her shattered skull.

**JANNAT**  
(hissing)  
- **Option A:** You want to know what it felt like? To have your skull crushed piece by piece while you begged for mercy? To feel your baby die inside you with each blow?
- **Option B:** Let me show you what you did to me. Let me return the favor, blow by blow.

**MARZIA**  
(screaming)  
- **Option A:** Stay away from me!
- **Option B:** Get back! I'll kill you again!

She swings the tire iron wildly, but Jannat catches it mid-swing and raises the sledgehammer with supernatural strength.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (2:15 AM)

The first blow cracks Marzia's skull open. Blood and brain matter spray across the room as she falls to her knees, still conscious.

**MARZIA**  
(whimpering, blood pouring)  
- **Option A:** Please... I only wanted to love you.
- **Option B:** Rumi... help me... I did this for us...

**JANNAT**  
- **Option A:** This is how you showed love? By torturing an innocent woman and her unborn child to death?
- **Option B:** Love? You don't know the meaning of the word.

The second blow caves in the left side of Marzia's head completely. Her left eye pops out, dangling by the optic nerve. She lives, gurgling on blood.

**JANNAT**  
(raising hammer)  
- **Option A:** One more, for our baby.
- **Option B:** This last one is for the son you murdered.

The third blow turns Marzia's head into paste. Skull fragments, brain tissue, and blood explode across the room like a grotesque firework.

Police sirens wail in the distance as Jannat's spirit begins to fade.

**JANNAT**  
(whisper)  
- **Option A:** Finally. Justice.
- **Option B:** It's done. She can't hurt anyone anymore.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (2:45 AM)

Police burst through the door to find unimaginable carnage. Marzia lies dead, head completely destroyed. Blood and brain matter paint the walls.

Standing over her with the sledgehammer is RUMI.

**RUMI**  
(calmly)  
- **Option A:** She killed my wife. She confessed everything before I stopped her.
- **Option B:** Dr. Marzia Rahman murdered my wife three years ago. She came here tonight to kill me too.

**POLICE OFFICER**  
Sir, drop the weapon and get on your knees.

**RUMI**  
(complying)  
- **Option A:** In her medical bag, you'll find drugs she was using to control me. In her apartment, there's evidence. She kept trophies from my wife's murder.
- **Option B:** Check her apartment. She documented everything. Photos, journals, evidence of her obsession.

### EXT. CEMETERY - DAY (Three Months Later)

Rumi stands beside two graves - Jannat's and a smaller one reading "Baby Bin Imran - Never Born But Always Loved." He places tiny baby shoes on the small mound.

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** I'm sorry I couldn't protect you both. But she can't hurt anyone anymore.
- **Option B:** I failed you. I should have seen what she was. But justice has been served now.

As he turns to leave, warmth envelops him. The scent of jasmine fills the air. For a brief moment, he sees them - Jannat, whole and healthy, holding a small child with his eyes.

They don't speak but smile before fading into the setting sun.

For the first time in three years, the echo of her voice isn't filled with pain - it's a whisper of peace, of closure, of a promise that someday, they'll be together again.

Rumi walks to his car with steady steps. He has a life to rebuild, a truth to honor, and a future to face - not with manipulation's numbing fog, but with the clarity of knowing the whole, terrible truth.

**FADE OUT.**

**THE END - BRANCH 1.2**

# BRANCH 2: THE UNEXPECTED VISITOR

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (7:40 PM)

**RUMI**  
(calling toward the window)  
- **Option A:** Who's there?
- **Option B:** Show yourself!

A figure steps into the porch light - DR. MARZIA RAHMAN (26), Rumi's childhood friend and personal physician. But something's off about her appearance. She's disheveled, breathing heavily, and there's a nervous energy about her that's unusual.

**MARZIA**  
(climbing through the window with forced cheerfulness)  
- **Option A:** Sorry! Didn't mean to scare you. I knocked on the front door but you didn't answer.
- **Option B:** Surprise! I know, I know, should've called first. But your doorbell seems broken.

**RUMI**  
(confused and slightly annoyed)  
- **Option A:** Marzia? You nearly gave me a heart attack. Why didn't you just call first?
- **Option B:** Jesus, Marzia! What are you doing climbing through my window?

**MARZIA**  
(forced laugh)  
- **Option A:** You know how you get on difficult days. I was worried you might not pick up.
- **Option B:** I tried calling. Three times. You didn't answer, so I got concerned.

She surveys the mess in the living room - the spilled tea, the overturned kettle.

**MARZIA**  
What happened here?

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** I was making tea when I heard something outside. The whole setup just... fell over.
- **Option B:** Not sure. One moment everything was fine, the next... this mess.

**MARZIA**  
(too quickly)  
- **Option A:** Probably the wind. It's picking up out there.
- **Option B:** Must've been a draft. These old houses are full of them.

But Rumi notices the windows were closed. How could wind have caused this?

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (8:00 PM)

As Marzia helps clean up the mess, Rumi observes her more carefully. Her hands are trembling slightly, and she keeps glancing toward the windows.

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** You seem nervous tonight. Everything okay at the hospital?
- **Option B:** Something's wrong. You're acting strange. What's going on?

**MARZIA**  
(defensive)  
- **Option A:** I'm fine. Just tired. Long shift.
- **Option B:** Nothing. Why would something be wrong? I'm perfectly fine.

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** It's Thursday. You don't usually work Thursdays.
- **Option B:** Thursday's your day off. You told me that yourself.

A pause. Marzia's cleaning slows.

**MARZIA**  
(recovering)  
- **Option A:** Emergency call-in. Dr. Hassan was sick.
- **Option B:** Schedule change. They needed extra hands in the ER.

But Rumi knows Dr. Hassan retired last month. He mentioned it to Marzia himself.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (8:15 PM)

The atmosphere grows tense. Marzia's explanations aren't adding up, and both of them know it.

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** Marzia, how long were you outside before you knocked?
- **Option B:** Tell me the truth. How long have you been watching my house?

**MARZIA**  
(too casually)  
- **Option A:** Just a few minutes. I was checking to see if your lights were on.
- **Option B:** Not long. Wanted to make sure you were home before bothering you.

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** From outside the window? Not from the front of the house?
- **Option B:** You can see my lights from the front door. Why were you at the window?

She doesn't answer immediately, focusing intently on folding a dish towel.

**MARZIA**  
- **Option A:** I thought I saw you through the window and didn't want to disturb you if you were resting.
- **Option B:** I was worried. Wanted to check on you without being intrusive.

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** But you just said I wasn't answering the front door.
- **Option B:** That doesn't make sense. You said you knocked and I didn't answer.

The contradiction hangs in the air between them. Marzia sets down the towel with deliberate care.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (8:30 PM)

**MARZIA**  
(changing subject)  
- **Option A:** How are you feeling today? I know anniversaries can be... difficult.
- **Option B:** Let's not talk about this. How are you doing? Today must be hard.

**RUMI**  
I'm managing.

**MARZIA**  
- **Option A:** Have you been taking your medication regularly?
- **Option B:** You're still on your prescriptions, right? Taking them as directed?

**RUMI**  
Yes.

**MARZIA**  
- **Option A:** All of it? The mood stabilizers and the memory supplements?
- **Option B:** Every pill? Including the ones I specifically prescribed for memory stabilization?

Memory supplements. That's what she calls them. But Rumi has never been entirely clear on why he needs medication to help with memory. His grief, yes. His sleep, yes. But memory?

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** Marzia, why do I take medication for memory?
- **Option B:** I've been meaning to ask - why exactly do I need those memory pills?

**MARZIA**  
(clinical tone)  
- **Option A:** Trauma can cause memory fragmentation. The medication helps prevent intrusive flashbacks and false memories from forming.
- **Option B:** Severe grief can create false recollections. The medication keeps your memories stable and accurate.

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** False memories of what?
- **Option B:** What kind of false memories are you talking about?

**MARZIA**  
(pause)  
- **Option A:** Of things that might have been different. Ways you might have saved her. Your mind sometimes creates scenarios that didn't happen.
- **Option B:** Guilt manifests as alternate timelines. Your brain tries to rewrite history. The pills prevent that.

But something in her tone suggests she's not telling him everything.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (8:45 PM)

The conversation has reached a turning point. Both Rumi and Marzia seem to be waiting for the other to reveal something.

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** I've been having strange dreams lately.
- **Option B:** Something's been happening. Dreams. Memories. I can't tell which is which anymore.

**MARZIA**  
(alert)  
- **Option A:** What kind of dreams?
- **Option B:** Tell me exactly what you've been seeing.

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** About that night. About things I can't quite remember.
- **Option B:** The accident. But the details are different from what you told me.

Marzia reaches for her medical bag - she always carries it when visiting him.

**MARZIA**  
- **Option A:** Maybe we should adjust your dosage. Increase the memory stabilizers.
- **Option B:** This is concerning. I think we need to up your medication immediately.

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** Or maybe I should stop taking them altogether. See what I remember.
- **Option B:** What if I just quit the pills? Let my mind clear naturally?

The suggestion clearly alarms her.

**MARZIA**  
- **Option A:** That would be very dangerous, Rumi. Some memories are suppressed for good reasons.
- **Option B:** Absolutely not. The psychological damage could be catastrophic. Trust me on this.

## BRANCH 2.1: THE PERFECT CRIME UNRAVELS

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING (7:40 PM)

**RUMI**  
(calling out)  
- **Option A:** Who's there?
- **Option B:** Show yourself or I'm calling the police!

The figure steps into the light - DR. MARZIA RAHMAN (26), his childhood friend. She appears disheveled, breathing heavily.

**MARZIA**  
(forcing a laugh, jumping through window)  
- **Option A:** Have you lost it or something?
- **Option B:** Seriously? You look like you've seen a ghost!

**RUMI**  
(angrily)  
- **Option A:** You nearly gave me a heart attack!
- **Option B:** What the hell, Marzia! Are you trying to kill me?

**MARZIA**  
- **Option A:** You're still scared of ghosts, aren't you? Grow up - you're twenty-seven, not seven, kiddo.
- **Option B:** Big tough man, scared by a little surprise visit. You haven't changed since childhood.

**RUMI**  
(pointing at mess)  
- **Option A:** This was you, wasn't it?
- **Option B:** You knocked over my tea, didn't you?

**MARZIA**  
(too enthusiastic)  
- **Option A:** Bullseye!
- **Option B:** Guilty as charged! My bad!

Rumi hands her a mop.

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** You're not leaving until that's clean.
- **Option B:** Clean it up. Every drop. I'm not doing it.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (8:15 PM)

While Marzia cleans, Rumi watches her with growing suspicion.

**MARZIA**  
What's wrong? You look like you've seen a ghost.

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** Marzia, why were you outside my window? How long were you watching me?
- **Option B:** Stop deflecting. Why were you spying on me through the window?

Marzia pauses mid-cleaning.

**MARZIA**  
- **Option A:** I... I was worried about you. Today marks three years since...
- **Option B:** You know what today is. I wanted to make sure you were okay.

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** Since the accident. But that doesn't explain why you were hiding outside instead of knocking.
- **Option B:** That doesn't answer my question. Why hide? Why watch?

He notices a fresh scratch on her hand.

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** How did you get that scratch?
- **Option B:** Your hand. That's fresh. What happened?

**MARZIA**  
(instinctively hiding hand)  
- **Option A:** Oh, this? Clumsy run-in with a file cabinet at the clinic. It's nothing.
- **Option B:** Occupational hazard. Caught it on a metal tray earlier. No big deal.

**RUMI**  
(studying window frame)  
- **Option A:** Funny. There's a nail sticking out of that window frame you were looking through. Just the right height.
- **Option B:** Interesting coincidence. See that nail on the window frame? Looks about hand-height.

Marzia's nervous laugh dies in her throat.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (8:30 PM)

The atmosphere grows tense. Rumi serves tea, but his movements are calculated, watchful.

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** I was on the phone with the police earlier today. Just a follow-up call.
- **Option B:** Interesting call I got today. Detective Hassan. Wanted to discuss Jannat's case.

**MARZIA**  
(trying to appear casual)  
- **Option A:** Oh? About what?
- **Option B:** Really? After three years? What did they want?

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** They told me something interesting. The case was never officially closed. Recently, they received an anonymous tip about another car being seen near Shyamoli Square that night.
- **Option B:** Apparently new evidence surfaced. Witness reports of a second vehicle at the scene. They're reopening the investigation.

The color drains from Marzia's face.

**MARZIA**  
- **Option A:** That's impossible. It was a deserted road. It was raining. No one was there.
- **Option B:** Can't be. I was... I mean, the reports said the area was completely empty.

The words hang in the air like a death sentence.

**RUMI**  
(voice dropping to whisper)  
- **Option A:** How would you know no one was there, Marzia? The police report said you were on call at the hospital all night.
- **Option B:** Funny thing, Marzia. You weren't at the scene. Or were you?

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (9:15 PM)

**MARZIA**  
(forcing smile)  
- **Option A:** Rumi, you're not making sense. The grief is making you paranoid. Maybe you should take your medication.
- **Option B:** You're confused. The pills - you haven't been taking them regularly, have you? That's why you're having these delusions.

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** Maybe I should call Detective Hassan right now. Ask him about that anonymous tip.
- **Option B:** I have his direct number. Should I dial it? Get the details straight from him?

Marzia's mask begins to slip. Her hands tremble as she sets down her teacup.

**MARZIA**  
- **Option A:** You don't want to do that, Rumi.
- **Option B:** That would be a mistake. Trust me.

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** Why not? What are you afraid they'll find?
- **Option B:** Afraid of something, Marzia? Some truth coming to light?

**MARZIA**  
(voice changing, becoming colder)  
- **Option A:** I'm not afraid of anything. But you should be.
- **Option B:** Fear? No. But you should be terrified of what happens next.

She stands slowly, reaching into her large handbag by the door.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (9:45 PM)

The charade is over. Marzia's expression shifts completely - the caring friend melting away to reveal something predatory and cold.

**MARZIA**  
(chilling smile)  
- **Option A:** You were always smarter than she was.
- **Option B:** I should have known you'd figure it out eventually. You're too clever for your own good.

**RUMI**  
(standing)  
- **Option A:** What did you just say?
- **Option B:** What are you talking about?

**MARZIA**  
- **Option A:** Yes, I was there. I followed her. I watched her die. And I'm the one who made sure she died.
- **Option B:** I killed her, Rumi. With these hands. And I'd do it again without hesitation.

**RUMI**  
(barely breathing)  
- **Option A:** You killed her.
- **Option B:** You murdered my wife.

**MARZIA**  
(voice dripping venom)  
- **Option A:** I corrected a cosmic error! I loved you! While you were wasting your life on her, I was building a career, making myself worthy of you!
- **Option B:** She was holding you back! I set you free! Everything I did was for us!

She pulls a blood-stained tire iron from her bag.

**MARZIA**  
- **Option A:** She was a placeholder, and her time was up.
- **Option B:** She was an obstacle. Nothing more. And obstacles must be removed.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (10:15 PM)

Rumi subtly places his phone on the armrest, activating the voice recorder as Marzia continues her confession with horrifying pride.

**MARZIA**  
- **Option A:** I lured her to the hospital parking garage. Told her I needed to give her a prenatal checkup.
- **Option B:** It was so easy. A phone call about urgent test results. She came running.

**RUMI**  
(shocked)  
- **Option A:** Prenatal?
- **Option B:** Wait... she was pregnant?

**MARZIA**  
(theatrical gasp)  
- **Option A:** Oh, did I forget to mention? She was pregnant, Rumi. Three months. She was going to tell you that night. She was carrying your son.
- **Option B:** Surprise! You were going to be a father. She had a whole announcement planned. Pathetic, really.

Rumi feels the world collapse beneath him.

**MARZIA**  
- **Option A:** I couldn't let her have that. So I took this tire iron to her head. I destroyed her beautiful face so you would forget her faster.
- **Option B:** A baby would have tied you to her forever. I couldn't allow that. So I bashed her skull in until she was unrecognizable.

She caresses the weapon lovingly.

**MARZIA**  
- **Option A:** Then I drove her to Shyamoli Square and staged the crash. I am the author of your freedom, Rumi.
- **Option B:** The car accident was my masterpiece. Every detail perfect. And you believed every word.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (10:50 PM)

**MARZIA**  
(moving toward door)  
- **Option A:** The pills I gave you weren't just for grief. They were to keep you in a fog. To keep you dependent. To keep you mine.
- **Option B:** Three years of chemical control. You never suspected a thing. You were so beautifully compliant.

She raises the tire iron menacingly.

**MARZIA**  
- **Option A:** I kept this as evidence of my devotion. I wanted it here tonight when you finally understood everything I've done for you.
- **Option B:** This weapon is sacred. Her blood is still on it. Tonight, it becomes yours too.

**RUMI**  
(backing away)  
- **Option A:** You're insane.
- **Option B:** You're a psychopath!

**MARZIA**  
(screaming)  
- **Option A:** I'M DEVOTED! And now you will finally thank me!
- **Option B:** I'M IN LOVE! And you WILL appreciate my sacrifice!

She lunges. Rumi throws a heavy glass tabletop, shattering it at her feet and making her stumble.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS (11:25 PM)

Blinded by pain, Marzia swings the tire iron wildly, connecting with Rumi's ribs. He crashes into the refrigerator, gasping as something cracks inside his chest.

**MARZIA**
(voice guttural through ruined lips)
- **Option A:** I'll kill you slowly! I'll peel the skin from your bones the way you've peeled it from my face!
- **Option B:** You'll suffer! Every second of agony you've caused me, returned tenfold!

She corners him, raising the tire iron for a killing blow. Rumi sees Jannat's face in his mind - alive, smiling, carrying the child he never knew existed. With desperate strength, he grabs a heavy cast iron pan.

The impact is sickening. The pan connects with Marzia's jaw, shattering it on contact. Blood and teeth spray across the kitchen tiles.

**MARZIA**
(choking on bone fragments)
- **Option A:** We... belong... together...
- **Option B:** This... was... meant... to be...

Neighbors have called police - sirens wail in the distance. Marzia advances on raw determination, face boiled, jaw shattered.

**RUMI**
(cornered, breaking chair leg)
- **Option A:** It's over, Marzia!
- **Option B:** Stay back! Don't make me do this!

As she lunges one final time, he drives the splintered wood upward, catching her under the chin. It penetrates through her throat.

Blood fountains between them. Her eyes go wide with shock. The tire iron falls with a clatter.

**MARZIA**
(dying whisper)
- **Option A:** I... only... wanted... you...
- **Option B:** We... could have... been... perfect...

She collapses forward, dead.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS (11:45 PM)

Police burst through the front door, finding a nightmare scene. The kitchen is painted in blood and viscera. Marzia lies face-down in a crimson pool, chair leg protruding from her throat.

Rumi sits against the wall, clutching broken ribs, phone in trembling hand - the audio recording still playing.

**RUMI**
(simply)
- **Option A:** She killed my wife. She killed my baby.
- **Option B:** Her confession is on the recording. She murdered Jannat and our unborn child.

**POLICE OFFICER**
Sir, we need you to put your hands where we can see them.

**RUMI**
(complying)
- **Option A:** The recording has her confession. Check her apartment - she kept evidence.
- **Option B:** It's all documented. The audio, the weapon, the trophies she kept. Check everything.

### EXT. CEMETERY - DAY (One Week Later)

News vans line the street. Headlines visible on newspapers: "DOCTOR'S DEADLY OBSESSION" and "MURDERED PREGNANT WIFE, DRUGGED HUSBAND FOR YEARS."

Rumi stands alone at Jannat's grave, ignoring the media circus.

**RUMI**
(to gravestone)
- **Option A:** I know the truth now. All of it. About the baby, about what she did to you, about the three years of lies.
- **Option B:** They told me everything. You were pregnant. You were coming home to tell me. And she stole it all.

He places a small bouquet of jasmine flowers on the grave.

**RUMI**
- **Option A:** I'm sorry I couldn't protect you. I'm sorry I never knew about our child.
- **Option B:** Forgive me. I was blind. I should have seen what she was doing.

### EXT. CEMETERY - CONTINUOUS (Three Months Later)

The media has moved on. Rumi stands beside two graves now - Jannat's and a smaller one reading "Baby Bin Imran - Never Born But Always Loved." He places tiny baby shoes on the small mound.

**RUMI**
- **Option A:** The truth is out now. She can't hurt anyone anymore. The whole world knows what she did.
- **Option B:** Justice has been served. Your story is known. You can rest now.

As he turns to leave, he feels a gentle warmth, like being embraced by sunlight. The scent of jasmine fills the air momentarily.

For a brief moment, he sees them - Jannat, whole and healthy, holding a small child with his eyes. They don't speak but smile at him before fading into the light of the setting sun.

**RUMI**
(whisper)
- **Option A:** Rest now. Both of you.
- **Option B:** Sleep peacefully. I'll carry your memory with me always.

For the first time in three years, the echo of her voice in his mind isn't filled with questions or pain. It's a gentle whisper of peace, of closure, of love that transcends death.

Rumi walks to his car with steady steps. He has a life to rebuild, a truth to honor, and a future to face - not with the numbing fog of manipulation, but with the clarity that comes from finally knowing the whole, terrible truth.

The echo of her love will always be with him, but now it comforts rather than haunts.

**FADE TO BLACK.**

**THE END - BRANCH 2.1**

## BRANCH 2.2: THE SUPPRESSED TRUTH

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (7:40 PM)

**RUMI**  
(calling toward the window)  
- **Option A:** Who's there?
- **Option B:** Show yourself right now!

The figure steps into the light - DR. MARZIA RAHMAN (26), his childhood friend and doctor. She appears concerned but slightly out of breath.

**MARZIA**  
(climbing through window)
- **Option A:** Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. I knocked on the front door but got no answer.
- **Option B:** Didn't mean to scare you. Your doorbell must be broken - I've been knocking for five minutes.

**RUMI**  
(confused)  
- **Option A:** Marzia? What are you doing here so late?
- **Option B:** It's almost eight. Why are you here?

**MARZIA**  
- **Option A:** I was worried. Today is... well, you know what day it is.
- **Option B:** The anniversary. I couldn't let you be alone tonight.

She notices the spilled tea and broken kettle on the floor.

**MARZIA**  
What happened here?

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** I... I'm not sure. I was making tea and then... I think I heard something outside.
- **Option B:** Something knocked over the kettle. I don't remember how.

Marzia studies his face with clinical concern.

**MARZIA**  
- **Option A:** Rumi, have you been taking your medication?
- **Option B:** Your pills. Tell me you've been taking them regularly.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (8:15 PM)

As Marzia helps clean up the mess, Rumi sits on the sofa, looking distant and confused.

**MARZIA**  
(concerned)  
- **Option A:** You're having one of your episodes again, aren't you? You seem disoriented.
- **Option B:** I can see it in your eyes. The fog. You're losing time again.

**RUMI**  
(hollow voice)  
- **Option A:** I'm fine. Just tired.
- **Option B:** Nothing's wrong. Leave it alone.

**MARZIA**  
- **Option A:** It's the anniversary. It's understandable that today would be difficult for you.
- **Option B:** Three years today. The trauma resurfaces. It's normal.

She moves to her medical bag, retrieving a pill bottle.

**MARZIA**  
- **Option A:** But you need to take your medication, Rumi. It helps keep the bad memories from overwhelming you.
- **Option B:** These pills are essential. They protect you from the worst of what happened.

**RUMI**  
(frowning, memory gaps troubling him)  
- **Option A:** Marzia, that night... the night of the accident. I was home, right?
- **Option B:** Something's bothering me. Where was I when Jannat died?

**MARZIA**  
(voice slightly too quick)  
- **Option A:** Yes, of course. You were here, asleep. The police called you, then you called me in a panic.
- **Option B:** Home in bed. You got the call around 3 AM. You were hysterical.

**RUMI**  
- **Option A:** I remember the morgue. But everything before that is... blank.
- **Option B:** The hospital is clear in my mind. But earlier that night... nothing.

**MARZIA**  
(handing him pills and water)  
- **Option A:** It's a trauma response. Your mind is protecting you from the pain.
- **Option B:** Dissociative amnesia. The brain's defense mechanism against unbearable trauma.

As Rumi swallows the pills, a troubling thought surfaces: What kind of pain needs this much protection?

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (9:00 PM)

As Marzia prepares his medication, Rumi stares at the black television screen. In the reflection, his face looks distorted. For a moment, he sees another image - his own face, contorted with rage.

**RUMI**
(suddenly)
- **Option A:** Marzia, that night... the night of the accident. I was home, right? You came and got me.
- **Option B:** Tell me again. Every detail. Where was I that night?

**MARZIA**
(voice slightly too quick)
- **Option A:** Yes, of course. You were here, asleep. The police called you, then you called me in a panic. I drove you to the hospital.
- **Option B:** Safe at home. Sleeping soundly until the call came. I drove you to identify the body.

**RUMI**
- **Option A:** I remember the morgue. But everything before that is... blank. A fog.
- **Option B:** Pulling back the sheet - that I remember. But the hours before... nothing.

**MARZIA**
(handing him pills and water)
- **Option A:** It's a trauma response. Your mind is protecting you from the pain. It's for the best.
- **Option B:** Selective amnesia. Your psyche shielding itself. Don't fight it.

As he swallows the pills, a rogue thought surfaces: Protecting me from what? The pain of loss, or the pain of knowledge?

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (9:45 PM)

They watch television in near silence. A news report about domestic violence catches Rumi's attention - a man who killed his wife upon discovering her affair.

Suddenly, an image flashes in Rumi's mind, vivid and terrifying. JANNAT standing in their bedroom, her face defiant.

**JANNAT (MEMORY)**
(screaming)
Yes, I love him! And I'm pregnant with his child!

Another flash - the heavy feel of a sledgehammer from his toolbox. The sickening crunch of bone. Blood spraying across floral wallpaper.

**RUMI**
(gasping)
- **Option A:** The wallpaper.
- **Option B:** We changed the wallpaper. Why?

**MARZIA**
(sharp with alarm)
- **Option A:** Rumi? What is it? You're pale as a sheet.
- **Option B:** What's wrong? You look like you're about to pass out.

**RUMI**
(staring at living room wall)
- **Option A:** We painted over the wallpaper in the bedroom. Why did we do that?
- **Option B:** The bedroom. We repainted it. Right after... why?

**MARZIA**
(eyes darting nervously)
- **Option A:** It was old. You wanted a change after... after she was gone. To help you move on.
- **Option B:** Fresh start. You needed to erase reminders. Standard grief response.

**RUMI**
(standing up)
- **Option A:** No. We painted it to cover the bloodstains.
- **Option B:** Blood. There was blood on those walls. Her blood.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS (10:30 PM)

Rumi stumbles toward the bedroom, Marzia following, pleading with him.

**MARZIA**
- **Option A:** Rumi, you're not thinking clearly! You're having a psychotic break!
- **Option B:** Stop this! The medication is wearing off and you're hallucinating!

He ignores her, going to the closet, digging until his hand closes around a sledgehammer handle. The memories flood back like a dam bursting.

Coming home early. Jannat with another man in their bed. The confession of the affair, the baby that wasn't his. The blinding, consuming rage.

**RUMI**
(choked whisper, turning to face Marzia)
- **Option A:** I didn't just kill her. I killed him too. What did we do with his body, Marzia?
- **Option B:** Two bodies. Not one. Him and Jannat. Where did you help me hide him?

**MARZIA**
(face crumpling, lie no longer sustainable)
- **Option A:** We staged it. Her on the street, him in J-Block. I helped you. You weren't... you weren't yourself.
- **Option B:** The construction site. J-Block foundation. Before the concrete pour. He's still there.

**RUMI**
- **Option A:** I did it to protect you!
- **Option B:** You helped me commit murder!

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS (11:00 PM)

The final, awful truth settles between them like a poisonous cloud.

**RUMI**
(knuckles white on sledgehammer handle)
- **Option A:** You let me believe I was a victim.
- **Option B:** Three years of lies. You made me think I was the grieving husband.

**MARZIA**
(sobbing)
- **Option A:** I love you! I've always loved you. I couldn't let them send you to prison!
- **Option B:** What was I supposed to do? Turn in the man I've loved since childhood?

In her desperate, twisted love, he sees a mirror of his own possessive rage that led to murder.

**MARZIA**
- **Option A:** I did what I had to do!
- **Option B:** My choices saved your life!

**RUMI**
- **Option A:** You didn't want me to heal. You wanted me broken so you could hold the pieces together.
- **Option B:** This wasn't love. This was control. You kept me sedated and dependent.

She reaches for a syringe in her medical bag.

**MARZIA**
- **Option A:** What now, Rumi? We can go on as we have. I can increase the dosage. You can forget again.
- **Option B:** We have a choice. More medication. Deeper suppression. You never have to remember.

He looks from the syringe to the sledgehammer. Forgetfulness was a prison. Truth was a death sentence. But it was his truth.

**RUMI**
- **Option A:** No more lies.
- **Option B:** I'm done living in your manufactured reality.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS (11:15 PM)

**MARZIA**
(panicked)
- **Option A:** Please, Rumi. Think about what you're doing. We've kept this secret for three years. We can keep it forever.
- **Option B:** Don't be stupid. Three years without suspicion. We're safe. Stay safe with me.

The sledgehammer feels impossibly heavy - not just from its weight, but from the memories it carries.

**RUMI**
(more to himself)
- **Option A:** I killed them both. I came home early. I heard them in our bedroom...
- **Option B:** I murdered my wife and her lover. In our bed. In our home.

**FLASHBACK - BEDROOM - NIGHT (March 13, 2022)**

*Younger Rumi opens the bedroom door. JANNAT (22) and a MAN (30s) are in bed together. They freeze, caught.*

**JANNAT (FLASHBACK)**
- **Option A:** Rumi! I can explainâ€”
- **Option B:** Wait! This isn't what it looks like!

**RUMI (FLASHBACK)**
(voice shaking with rage)
- **Option A:** How long?
- **Option B:** Tell me everything. Now.

**JANNAT (FLASHBACK)**
(climbing out of bed)
- **Option A:** Six months. I'm pregnant, Rumi. It's his child.
- **Option B:** We've been together since last summer. The baby I'm carrying - it's his.

**MAN (FLASHBACK)**
(standing)
- **Option A:** Look, man, we didn't mean for you to find out this wayâ€”
- **Option B:** Listen, we were going to tell you. We're in love.

*Past-Rumi disappears, returning with the sledgehammer.*

**JANNAT (FLASHBACK)**
(pleading)
- **Option A:** Rumi, please! We can work this out!
- **Option B:** Don't do this! We can talk! Please!

*The first swing takes the man in the temple. He drops instantly.*

**JANNAT (FLASHBACK)**
(screaming, running)
- **Option A:** NO! RUMI, NO!
- **Option B:** STOP! OH GOD, PLEASE STOP!

*He catches her in the hallway. The second swing ends her screams forever.*

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - PRESENT (11:30 PM)

**RUMI**
(tears streaming)
- **Option A:** She told me she was pregnant with his child. That they were starting a new life together.
- **Option B:** Six months. They'd been together six months. The baby wasn't mine.

**MARZIA**
(step toward him)
- **Option A:** She betrayed you. She deserved what she got.
- **Option B:** She made her choice. You responded with justified rage.

**RUMI**
(sharp accusation)
- **Option A:** And what did you deserve, Marzia? You didn't call the police. You didn't try to stop me. You helped me. Why?
- **Option B:** You're complicit. An accessory. Why did you protect me?

**MARZIA**
(complex emotion - devotion and possession)
- **Option A:** Because I've loved you since we were children. I watched you waste that love on her, and she repaid you with betrayal.
- **Option B:** I've waited my whole life for you. She took what should have been mine. Her death was... convenient.

**RUMI**
- **Option A:** So you saw an opportunity.
- **Option B:** You used my crime to bind me to you.

**MARZIA**
- **Option A:** I saw a chance to save you! I knew how to make it look like an accident. I knew how to help you forget.
- **Option B:** I saved your life! The staging, the medication, the false memories - all of it kept you free!

**RUMI**
(bitter laugh)
- **Option A:** You didn't want me to forget to heal me. You wanted me to forget so I'd be dependent on you.
- **Option B:** This was never about helping me. It was about owning me.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS (11:50 PM)

**RUMI**
- **Option A:** What did we do with their bodies? Tell me everything. No more sedatives, no more half-truths.
- **Option B:** Every detail. The staging, the disposal, the cover-up. I need to know it all.

Marzia's professional demeanor crumbles. Her hands shake as she begins to speak.

**MARZIA**
- **Option A:** You killed them both in here. He died first - one blow to the temple. But Jannat... she tried to run. You caught her in the hallway.
- **Option B:** The man was instant. Skull fracture, brain hemorrhage. Dead before he hit the floor. Jannat fought. She made it to the hallway before you caught her.

Her clinical detachment returns as she recounts the details.

**MARZIA**
- **Option A:** Multiple blunt force traumas to the cranium. Catastrophic brain injury. Death was immediate.
- **Option B:** Seventeen separate impacts. The skull was completely shattered. She died on the fourth blow, but you didn't stop.

**RUMI**
- **Option A:** And then I called you.
- **Option B:** I called you from this room, covered in their blood.

**MARZIA**
- **Option A:** You were incoherent. Covered in blood. I came immediately. I knew what to do.
- **Option B:** 11:47 PM. You were sobbing, couldn't form complete sentences. I arrived within twenty minutes.

A flicker of pride crosses her features.

**MARZIA**
- **Option A:** I cleaned you up first. Then we wrapped his body in plastic from the garage. Put him in my car trunk.
- **Option B:** Shower first, to clear your head and remove evidence. Then we dealt with the bodies systematically.

**RUMI**
- **Option A:** And Jannat?
- **Option B:** What about my wife?

**MARZIA**
- **Option A:** We made it look like she'd been in his car. Like they were running away together and crashed. I used my medical knowledge to ensure the injuries matched a high-speed collision.
- **Option B:** The car accident was my design. Positioned the body, created secondary trauma consistent with vehicular impact. No one questioned it.

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (12:15 AM)
*April 4, 2025*

Rumi sinks onto the sofa, sledgehammer sliding from his grip. The full weight of his actions crushes down on him.

**RUMI**
- **Option A:** I'm not a grieving widower. I'm a murderer.
- **Option B:** Everything I believed about myself... it's all lies. I'm a monster.

**MARZIA**
(desperate)
- **Option A:** We can increase your medication. You can forget again. We can move away, start fresh.
- **Option B:** More pills, stronger doses. I can make this go away again. We can be happy.

**RUMI**
- **Option A:** Did you ever feel guilt? Even once in three years?
- **Option B:** How do you live with this? How do you sleep?

**MARZIA**
- **Option A:** Guilt? For what? For protecting you? For loving you enough to save you from yourself?
- **Option B:** I saved your life. I gave you three more years of freedom. That's not something to feel guilty about.

In that moment, Rumi sees her clearly - not as his friend or caretaker, but as someone whose love had mutated into monstrous possession.

**RUMI**
(quietly, reaching for phone)
- **Option A:** I'm calling the police.
- **Option B:** This ends now. I'm confessing everything.

**MARZIA**
(lunging, knocking phone away)
- **Option A:** You can't! I won't let you throw everything away!
- **Option B:** NO! I didn't sacrifice everything for you to destroy it now!

### INT. RUMI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS (12:30 AM)

The struggle is brief but violent. Marzia fights with desperate strength, clawing at his face, screaming about sacrifice and devotion.

When she reaches for the fallen sledgehammer, something in Rumi snaps.

He doesn't remember grabbing her throat. Doesn't remember squeezing until her eyes bulge and face turns purple. Doesn't remember the crack as her trachea collapses.

When awareness returns, Marzia lies motionless, eyes fixed on the ceiling. Her medical bag is spilled - pills, syringes, and the fiction of his innocence scattered like confetti.

Rumi stares at what he's done, then picks up his phone with mechanical precision.

**RUMI**
(dialing)
- **Option A:** Emergency services.
- **Option B:** Police. I need police.

**OPERATOR (V.O.)**
Emergency services.

**RUMI**
(voice steady)
- **Option A:** I need to report a murder. Three murders, actually.
- **Option B:** I'm confessing to homicide. Multiple victims over three years.

### INT. PRISON CELL - DAY (Weeks Later)

The cell is small, sterile. Rumi sits on the narrow cot, alone with his memories at last.

For three years, he lived a lie constructed by toxic devotion. Now, facing consequences, he's finally free from manipulation, false memories, and the drugs that kept him prisoner in his own mind.

**RUMI**
(to himself)
- **Option A:** The truth of what I did will haunt me until I die. But the truth is better than the comfortable lie.
- **Option B:** I killed three people. I deserve everything that's coming. At least now I'm not living in a fog.

He thinks of Jannat - not as she was in death, but alive, laughing, real. Her voice will follow him into old age, into whatever afterlife awaits. But now it's her true voice he hears - not the distorted whisper planted in his drugged mind.

The cell door is locked, but for the first time in three years, there are no more lies. The monster he discovered is terrible to behold, but at least now he faces it with clear eyes.

**RUMI**
(whisper)
- **Option A:** No more lies.
- **Option B:** I finally see clearly.

**FADE TO BLACK.**

**THE END - BRANCH 2.2**
